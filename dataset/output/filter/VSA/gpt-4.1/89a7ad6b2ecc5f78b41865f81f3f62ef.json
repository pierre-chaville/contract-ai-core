      "confidence": 1.0,
      "explanation": "Lines 2-8 contain the contract title, date, parties, and introductory language, which together form the preamble of the CSA. Line 2 gives the document name, lines 3-4 reference the ISDA Master Agreement and its date, lines 5-6 list the parties, and lines 7-8 provide the introductory context and agreement to the terms. This is the standard structure for a CSA preamble."

      "start_line": 10,
      "end_line": 182,
      "confidence": 1.0,
      "explanation": "The Annex, containing the negotiated terms of the CSA, begins at 'Paragraph 13. Elections and Variables' (line 10) and continues through the signature block (line 182). This matches the standard structure for a New York law CSA, where Paragraph 13 is the annex. The preceding lines (9 and earlier) are generic incorporation language, and line 183 and beyond are exhibits and not part of the negotiated annex."
