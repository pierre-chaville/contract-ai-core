      "explanation": "Lines 270-606 contain the full Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement, including all its parts and elections. The Schedule begins at line 270 (\"SCHEDULE to the ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT\") and ends at the signature block at line 606. The preceding lines are the standard pre-printed Master Agreement, and the following lines (from 609 onward) are the Credit Support Annex and its variables, which are not part of the Schedule itself. This span fully matches the user's request to filter the Schedule and ignore other sections."
