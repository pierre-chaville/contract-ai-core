      "explanation": "The ISDA Schedule begins at line 351 (\"SCHEDULE\") and continues through the signature block at line 515. This section contains the negotiated terms between the parties, as required by the query, and excludes the standard pre-printed Master Agreement and the Credit Support Annex, which starts at line 517. The span is contiguous and matches the user's request to filter for the Schedule only."
