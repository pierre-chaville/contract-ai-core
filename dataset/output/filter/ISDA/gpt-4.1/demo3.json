      "explanation": "Lines 0-165 comprise the entire Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement, including all its Parts (1-5) and their respective provisions. The text starts with the heading 'SCHEDULE' and ends with the execution block. There is no indication of standard pre-print, CSA annexes, or other sections outside the Schedule within these lines. The signature block at line 166-167 is not part of the substantive Schedule, so the span ends at line 165."
