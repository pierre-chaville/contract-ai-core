      "explanation": "Lines 254-391 contain the full text of the Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement, starting with the heading 'SCHEDULE' and ending with the execution block for the Schedule. This section includes all the negotiated terms, elections, and party-specific provisions that are the purpose of the Schedule, and is clearly demarcated from the standard pre-printed Master Agreement and from the CSA annexes that follow. The user's request is to filter for the Schedule only, which is exactly this span."
