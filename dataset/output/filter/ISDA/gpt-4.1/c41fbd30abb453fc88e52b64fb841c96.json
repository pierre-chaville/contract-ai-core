      "explanation": "Lines 262-292 contain the Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement, which is the negotiated part that supplements and amends the standard pre-printed form. The lines before this are the standard form, and there is no indication of a CSA annex or other documents in this excerpt. The Schedule is typically appended at the end, and the content here matches the expected format and content of an ISDA Schedule."
