      "explanation": "The ISDA Schedule begins at line 327 with the heading 'SCHEDULE to the 2002 ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT' and continues through the various Parts (1 through 6), ending at line 419 before the signature block. This span contains all the negotiated terms and elections specific to the parties, which is the content of the Schedule. The lines before 327 are the standard pre-printed Master Agreement, and lines after 419 are signatures and not part of the Schedule."
