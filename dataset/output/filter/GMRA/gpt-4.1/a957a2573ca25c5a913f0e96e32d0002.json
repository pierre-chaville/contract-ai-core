      "explanation": "The preamble is defined as the beginning of the contract up to the start of the standard preprint, which typically begins with '1. Applicability'. Here, line 9 is the start of '1. Applicability', so the preamble is lines 0 through 8."

      "start_line": 280,
      "end_line": 404,

      "explanation": "Annex 1 is clearly marked starting at line 280 ('ANNEX 1') and continues through the supplemental terms and conditions, ending just before 'ANNEX II' at line 405. Thus, lines 280-404 comprise Annex 1."
