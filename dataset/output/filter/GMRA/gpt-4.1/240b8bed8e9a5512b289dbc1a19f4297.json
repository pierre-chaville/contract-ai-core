      "explanation": "The preamble is defined as the beginning of the contract up to the start of the standard preprint, which typically begins with '1. Applicability'. Here, line 11 is the start of '1. Applicability', so the preamble is lines 0-10."

      "explanation": "Annex 1 is clearly marked starting at line 304 ('ANNEX 1') and continues through the supplemental terms and conditions, ending before the next section (the Confirmation) at line 367. Thus, lines 304-366 comprise Annex 1."
