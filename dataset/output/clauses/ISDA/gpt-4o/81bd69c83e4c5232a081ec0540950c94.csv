Party B understands that such termination or modification may, in certain circumstances, result in significant losses and may include additional amounts required to be paid by Party B to cover relevant costs. As in any financial transaction, Party B understands the requirements, if any, applicable to Party B that are established by regulators or by Party B's board of directors or other governing body. Party B should also consider the legal, tax, accounting, and economic implications of entering into any Rate Management Transaction, independently, and if necessary, through consultation with such advisors as may be appropriate to assist it in understanding the risks involved."
