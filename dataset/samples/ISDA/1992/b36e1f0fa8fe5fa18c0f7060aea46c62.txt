(a) 	 Set Off. Without affecting the provisions of this Agreement requiring the calculation of certain net payment amounts, all payments under this Agreement will be made without setoff or counterclaim, except that each party to this Agreement (such party, "Party X") agrees that, upon an Early Termination Date resulting from an Event of Default with respect to Party X the other party hereto (such other party, a "Non-Defaulting Party") may, without prior notice, reduce any amounts due and owing to Party X under this Agreement or any other transactions between Party X and the Non-Defaulting Party by setting off against such amounts any amounts due and owing to the Non-Defaulting Party by Party X hereunder or under any other transactions between Party X and the Non-defaulting Party. For this purpose, any amount which is denominated in a currency other than U.S. Dollars may be converted by the Non-defaulting Party into U.S. Dollars at the rate of exchange at which such party would be able, acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith, to purchase such amount. The rights provided by this paragraph are in addition to and not in limitation of any other right or remedy (including any right to setoff, counterclaim, or otherwise withhold payment) to which a party may be entitled (whether by operation of law, contract or otherwise). Nothing in this Section shall be effective to create a charge or other security interest.
(b) 	 Definitions. The definitions and provisions contained in the 2000 ISDA Definitions (as published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc.), without regard to any amendment or supplement thereof subsequent to the date of this Agreement (the "ISDA Definitions"), are hereby incorporated in this Agreement. If a conflict exists (1) between the provisions of the ISDA Definitions and this Agreement, this Agreement will prevail, (2) between the provisions of a Confirmation and the ISDA Definitions, the Confirmation will prevail and (3) between the provisions of a Confirmation and this Agreement, the Confirmation will prevail.
(c) 	 Conditions Precedent. The condition precedent in Section 2(a)(iii)(1) of this Agreement shall not apply with respect to a payment or delivery owing by a party in respect of a Transaction if the other party shall have satisfied in full all of its payment or delivery obligations under 2(a)(i) of this Agreement in respect of such Transaction and shall at the relevant time have no future payment or delivery obligations, whether absolute or contingent, under Section 2(a)(i) in respect of such Transaction.
(d) 	 Default Under Specified Transactions. The provisions of Section 5(a)(v) of this Agreement are modified by adding, immediately prior to the semicolon at the end thereof, the following:
"provided, however, that it shall not constitute an Event of Default under Section 5(a)(v) if (A) such event of default or failure to pay arises in the ordinary course of business by mistake, oversight, or transfer difficulties and (B) such event of default or failure to pay is remedied on or before the fifth Business Day after the occurrence or existence of such event of default or failure to pay."
(e) 	 Termination Payments by Non-Defaulting Party. Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 6(e) and 6(d) of this Agreement, if there is a Defaulting Party, the obligations of the other party (the "Non-Defaulting Party") to pay to the Defaulting Party any amount under Section 6(e) shall not arise until, and shall be subject to the conditions precedent that the Non-Defaulting Party shall have received confirmation satisfactory to it in its sole discretion that (1) all Transactions are terminated in accordance with Section 6(c), (2) each Specified Transaction shall have terminated pursuant to its specified termination date or has been terminated through the exercise by a party of a right to terminate, and all amounts due under each Specified Transaction shall have been fully and finally paid, and (3) all obligations (contingent or absolute, matured or unmatured) of the Defaulting Party to make any payment to the Non-Defaulting Party shall have been fully and finally performed; provided that, if under the foregoing provisions it is determined that the Non-Defaulting Party is to make a payment to the Defaulting Party, there shall be deducted from the amount of such payment all amounts which the Defaulting Party may be obligated to pay under Section 11\. With respect to the foregoing clause (2), it is expressly agreed that the Non-Defaulting Party shall have no obligation to exercise any right it may have to terminate a Specified Transaction prior to its specified termination date.
(f) 	 All Confirmations. With respect to each Transaction other than a Subject Transaction, Party B will, on or promptly after the Trade Date thereof, send Party A a Confirmation of the terms and conditions of the Transaction in substantially the form set out as Exhibit I to the Definitions (or such other form as may be agreed by the parties). Party B will promptly thereafter (1) confirm the accuracy of such Confirmation or (2) request correction of the Confirmation, indicating how the terms of such Confirmation should be correctly stated and such other terms as should be added or deleted from such Confirmation to make it correct. The parties hereby agree that any exchange of telexes or facsimile transmissions or exchange of electronic messages on an electronic messaging system shall constitute a Confirmation for all purposes hereunder, even where not so specified therein. Each Subject Transaction and each other Transaction (whether now existing or hereafter entered into) between the parties to this Agreement, in respect of which the Confirmation fails by its terms expressly to subject such transaction to the provisions of any other master agreement between the parties, shall be deemed to incorporate the terms of, and shall be governed by and subject to, this Agreement and for purposes hereof shall be deemed to be a "Transaction."
(g) 	 Transfer. The consent referred to in Section 7 shall not (after consideration of any tax or other consequences to a party of consenting to such assignment) be unreasonably withheld.
(h) 	 Definitions. The definition of "Default Rate" in Section 14 is hereby amended by deleting such definition and substituting in lieu thereof the following:
"Default Rate " means, for each day that such rate is relevant, the rate per annum equal to the cost (without proof or evidence of any actual cost) to the relevant payee (as certified by it) if it
were to fund or of funding the relevant amount for such day plus 1% per annum provided, however, that in respect of any overdue amount denominated in United States Dollars the Default Rate for each such day shall be the per annum rate which equals the overnight USD Federal Funds - H.15 rate for such day plus 2%.
(i) 	 No Reliance. Without limiting the representations explicitly set out herein, each party has entered into this Agreement and each Transaction in reliance only upon its judgment, in order to accomplish legitimate business needs. Neither party holds itself out as advising, or any of its employees or agents as having any authority to advise, the other party as to whether or not it should enter into this Agreement or any Transaction. Neither party is receiving any compensation from the other party for providing advice in respect of this Agreement or any Transaction, and any such advice provided to such other party will not form the primary basis for an investment decision by such other party.
(j) 	 Impossibility. The occurrence of an Impossibility shall also be a Termination Event, as to which the Affected Party shall be subject to an Impossibility. For purposes of this Agreement, "Impossibility" shall mean the occurrence of a natural or man-made disaster, armed conflict, act of terrorism, riot, labor disruption or any other circumstances beyond its control after the date on which a Transaction is entered into which continues for a period of more than twenty (20) days and which makes it impossible (other than as a result of its own misconduct) for such a party:
(1) 	 to perform any absolute or contingent obligation, to make a payment or delivery or to receive a payment or delivery in respect of such Transaction or to comply with any other material provision of this Agreement relating to such transaction; or
(2) 	 to perform, or for any Credit Support Provider of such Party to perform, any contingent or other obligation which the party (or such Credit Support Provider) has under any Credit Support Document relating to such Transaction.
All terms and conditions of this Agreement applicable to an Illegality shall be equally applicable to an Impossibility and the definition of Termination Event shall be amended to include Impossibility.
(k) 	 Additional Representations. Section 3(a) is amended by adding the following paragraphs (vi) and (vii):

Each of Party A and Party B intends that each Transaction and the Agreement be categorized as a "swap agreement" and a "qualified financial contract" and that the Agreement be categorized as a "master agreement," for purposes of Section 11(e)(8) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or any successor provisions.
(iv) 	 Authorized Officer. Party B agrees that this Agreement, any Credit Support Document to which it is a party, each Confirmation, and any other documentation relating to this Agreement to which it is a party or that it is required to deliver will be executed and delivered by a duly appointed or elected and authorized officer of Party B of the level of vice-president or higher.
