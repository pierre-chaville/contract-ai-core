(C) 	  if, on such Early Termination Date, no Market Quotation for the relevant Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions has been accepted by Party B so as to become legally binding and no Market Quotations have been communicated to Party B and remain capable of becoming legally binding upon acceptance by Party B, Party B's Loss (whether positive or negative and without reference to any Unpaid Amounts) for the relevant Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions."
(iv) 	  If Party B requests Party A in writing to obtain Market Quotations, Party A will use its reasonable efforts to do so before the Early Termination Date.
(v) 	  If the Settlement Amount is a negative number, Section 6(e)(i)(3) of this Agreement will be deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:
"Second Method and Market Quotation. If Second Method and Market Quotation apply, (1) Party B will pay to Party A an amount equal to the absolute value of the Settlement Amount in respect of the Terminated Transactions, (2) Party B will pay to Party A the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to Party A and (3) Party A will pay to Party B the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to Party B; provided that (i) the amounts payable under (2) and (3) will be subject to netting in accordance with Section 2(c) of this Agreement and (ii) notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any amount payable by Party A under (3) will not be netted-off against any amount payable by Party B under (1)."

Party A may also, at its own cost, procure either (A) an Eligible Guarantee in respect of all of Party A's present and future obligations under this Agreement to be provided by a guarantor having the S&P First Trigger Required Ratings and which procurement will not be effective without the prior written confirmation of S&P that such procurement will not cause S&P to reduce or withdraw its then current rating on the Notes or (B) a transfer to a Financial Institution in accordance with Part 5(p)(ii) above, and upon either such procurement, Party A will no longer be required to post any collateral.
