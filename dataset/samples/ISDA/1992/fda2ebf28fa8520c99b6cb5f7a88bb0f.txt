X will give notice to the other party of any set-off effected under this paragraph, The failure to provide notice of set-off does not affect the validity of such set-off.
For this purpose, either the Early Termination Amount or the Other Agreement Amount (or the relevant portion of such amounts) may be converted by X into the currency in which the other is denominated at the rate of exchange at which such party would be able, acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith, to purchase the relevant amount of such currency.  The term "rate of exchange" includes, without limitation, any premiums and costs of exchange payable in connection with the purchase of or conversion into the relevant currency.
If any obligation is unascertained, X may in good faith estimate that obligation and set-off in respect of the estimate, subject to the relevant party accounting to the other party when the obligation is ascertained.

`(ii)`The rights given to each party hereunder upon an Event of Default by the other to cause the liquidation and termination of Transactions and to set-off mutual debts and claims in connection therewith, may not be stayed, limited or avoided under the Bankruptcy Code including, without limitation, Section 362, 365(e) or 105(a) of the Bankruptcy Code.

`(iv)`For purposes of this Agreement, such party is not a "utility" as such term is used in 11 U.S.C. Section 366, and therefore each party waives and agrees not to assert the applicability of the provisions of 11 U.S.C. Section 366 in any bankruptcy proceeding wherein such party is a debtor.  In any such proceeding, each party further waives the right to assert that the other party is a provider of last resort.
`(i)`Severability.  Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction will, as to such jurisdiction only, be ineffective to the limited extent of such prohibition or unenforceability unless such severance will materially impair the benefits of the remaining portions of this Agreement or materially change the reciprocal obligations of the parties.  Any severance will occur without otherwise invalidating or adversely affecting the validity or enforceability of the remainder of this Agreement in such jurisdiction or invalidating or adversely affecting the validity or enforceability of this Agreement as a whole in any other jurisdiction.  If severance is required, the parties shall in good faith negotiate a replacement for the prohibited or unenforceable provision, the economic effect of which approximates as close as possible that of the prohibited or unenforceable provision.
`(j)`WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.  EACH PARTY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY CREDIT SUPPORT DOCUMENT.  EACH PARTY:

`(ii)`ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTY HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND PROVIDE FOR ANY CREDIT SUPPORT DOCUMENT, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.
`(k)`Termination of Agreement.  If there are no Transactions (or any present or future payment or delivery obligations, contingent or otherwise, thereunder) outstanding under this Agreement, either party may, upon thirty
(30) Local Business Days' notice to the other, terminate this Agreement.  Such termination will not prejudice any rights or obligations that may have accrued prior to such termination.
DB1/ 95864532.2
`(l)`Consent to Recording.  Each party consents to the recording of all telephone conversations between its employees and agents and the employees and agents of the other party and each party represents and warrants that its employees and agents have consented to all such recordings.

`(m)`LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  NO PARTY IS LIABLE FOR OR REQUIRED TO PAY EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES (WHETHER OR NOT ARISING FROM ITS NEGLIGENCE) TO ANY OTHER PARTY, BUT NOTHING IN THIS PROVISION AFFECTS THE ENFORCEABILITY OF SECTION 6(E) OF THIS AGREEMENT.  IF AND TO THE EXTENT ANY PAYMENT REQUIRED TO BE MADE PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT IS DEEMED TO CONSTITUTE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES, THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT SUCH DAMAGES ARE DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE AND THAT SUCH PAYMENT IS INTENDED TO BE A REASONABLE APPROXIMATION OF THE AMOUNT OF THE DAMAGES AND NOT A PENALTY.

`(a)```Absent the agreement of all parties to the proposed change, the standard of review for changes to any rate, charge, classification, term or condition of this Agreement, whether proposed by a party (to the extent that any waiver in subsection (b) below is unenforceable or ineffective as to such party), a non-party or FERC acting sua sponte , will solely be the "public interest" application of the "just and reasonable" standard of review set forth in United Gas Pipe Line Co. v.

to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, neither party shall unilaterally seek to obtain from FERC any relief changing the rate, charge, classification, or other term or condition of this Agreement, notwithstanding any subsequent changes in applicable law or market conditions that may occur.
In the event it were to be determined that applicable law precludes the parties from waiving their rights to seek changes from FERC to their market- based power sales contracts (including entering into covenants not to do so) then this subsection (b) shall not apply, provided that, consistent with the foregoing subsection (a), neither party shall seek any such changes except solely under the "public interest" application of the "just and reasonable" standard of review and otherwise as set forth in the foregoing subsection (a)."
