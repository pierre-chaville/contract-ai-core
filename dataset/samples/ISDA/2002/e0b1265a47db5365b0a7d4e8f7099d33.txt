For the avoidance of doubt, no such limitation shall apply with respect to any Event of Default or Potential Event of Default under Section 5(a)(i).
(2)The condition precedent in Section 2(a)(iii)(1) does not apply to a payment or delivery owing by a party if the other party shall have satisfied in full all its payment and delivery obligations under Section 2(a)(i) of the Agreement and shall at the relevant time have no future payment or delivery obligations, whether absolute or contingent, under Section 2(a)(i).
(y)Limitation on Designation of Early Termination Date. If a party ("X") that receives written notice from the other party ("Y") specifically stating that there has occurred (x) an Event of Default as to which Y is the Defaulting Party or (y) any Termination Event as to which Y is an Affected Party, then, notwithstanding anything in Section 9(f) of this Agreement to the contrary, X shall have no further right to designate an Early Termination Date by reason of the Event of Default or Termination Event specified in such notice after ninety
(90) Local Business Days have elapsed following the date on which X receives such notice. Notice will be delivered to the addressee(s) for the other party as contained in Part 3 above.

Part 6. FX Transactions and Currency Option Transactions
(a)Application of this Agreement. This Agreement, as modified by this Part 6, shall apply to all FX Transactions and Currency Option Transactions (as defined in the 1998 FX and Currency Option Definitions, as amended or supplemented from time to time, published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc., the Emerging Markets Traders Association and The Foreign Exchange Committee (the "FX Definitions")) entered into or outstanding (whether before or after this Agreement is entered into) between the Parties.
(b)Confirmations. Any confirmation in respect of an FX Transaction or Currency Option Transaction between the parties, including but not limited to Confirmations sent by electronic means, that fails by its terms to expressly exclude the application of this Agreement shall (to the extent not otherwise provided for in this Agreement) (i) constitute a "Confirmation" as referred to in this Agreement even where not so specified in such confirmation; (ii) supplement, form a part of, and be subject to this Agreement, and all provisions in this Agreement will govern such Confirmation except as modified therein and (iii) shall incorporate the FX Definitions. In the event of any inconsistency between the FX Definitions and this Agreement, this Agreement will govern. In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of any Confirmation and this Agreement or the FX Definitions, such Confirmation will prevail for the purposes of the relevant Transaction.
(c)Discharge and Termination. Unless otherwise agreed, any Call or any Put written by a party will automatically be terminated and discharged, in whole or in part, as applicable, against a Call or a Put, respectively, written by the other party, such termination and discharge to occur automatically upon the payment in full of the last Premium payable in respect of such Currency Option Transactions; provided that such termination and discharge may only occur in respect of Currency Option Transactions:
(1)each being with respect to the same Put Currency and the same Call Currency;
(2)each having the same Expiration Date and Expiration Time;
(3)each being of the same style, i.e. either both being American style Currency Option Transactions or both being European style Currency Option Transactions;
(4)each having the same Strike Price;
(5)neither of which shall have been exercised by delivery of a Notice of Exercise; and
(6)each having been entered into by the same pair of Offices of the Buyer and the Seller
and, upon the occurrence of such termination and discharge, neither party shall have any further obligation to the other party in respect of the relevant Currency Option Transactions or, as the case may be, parts thereof so terminated and discharged. In the case of a partial termination and discharge (i.e., where the relevant Currency Option Transactions are for different amounts of the Currency Pair), the remaining portion of the Currency Option Transaction which is partially discharged and terminated shall continue to be a Currency Option Transaction for all purposes of this Agreement, including this Part 6(c). Such termination and discharge shall be effective notwithstanding that either party (i) may fail to send out a Confirmation, (ii) may fail to record such termination and discharge in its books, or (iii) may send out a Confirmation that is inconsistent with such termination and discharge.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF the parties have executed this Schedule on the respective dates specified below with effect from the date specified on the first page of this Agreement.
