The parties shall be legally bound from the time they so agree to terms of a Transaction and may each rely thereon. Failure by any party to send, or the other party to return, an executed Confirmation shall not invalidate any Transaction agreed to by the parties in a telephone conversation. Provided, however , that any discrepancy between the terms set forth on a fully executed Confirmation and those on a recording shall be resolved in favor of the terms on the fully executed Confirmation.
(2) Statute of Frauds. The parties agree not to contest, or to enter any defense concerning the validity or enforceability of any Transaction on the grounds that the documentation for such Transaction fails to comply with the requirements of any jurisdiction's (of whatever country, province, or state) statute of frauds or any other statute, regulation or judicial decision that agreements be written or signed.
(3) Counterparts. The parties hereby amend Section 9(e) by revising the header to read "Counterparts, Copies and Confirmations" and adding the following as a new subsection (iii): "(iii) Copies of this Agreement and any Confirmation (and each amendment, modification and waiver in respect of it) are deemed acceptable and may be used in lieu of originals for all purposes, including, but not limited to admissibility, authenticity or other purposes related to legal proof."
(4) Confirmation of a Transaction. The parties hereby amend Section 9(e)(ii) by adding the following sentences at the end thereof:
"Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties may agree to use the ICE eConfirm Service provided by the Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. ("ICE") in accordance with the procedures published by ICE. If either party has a dispute about any contents of a Confirmation received from the other party, it shall notify the other party within two (2) Local Business Days after the receipt of such Confirmation and the parties shall in good faith make reasonable efforts to resolve the dispute. A failure by a party to issue a Confirmation shall not prejudice or invalidate the terms of the relevant transaction governed by the Agreement. If the ICE eConfirm Service is not used Party A shall send a Confirmation to Party B within three (3) Local Business Days after the relevant Trade Date. Party B will promptly thereafter confirm the accuracy of or request the correction of such Confirmation. If Party B fails to accept or dispute the Confirmation in the manner set forth above within two (2) Local Business Days after it was effectively sent to Party B the Confirmation will be deemed to correctly reflect the parties' agreement on the terms of the Transaction referred to therein, absent manifest error. The requirement of this Section and elsewhere in this Agreement that the parties exchange Confirmations shall for all purposes be deemed satisfied by a Confirmation sent and an acknowledgment deemed given as provided herein. Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, if a Confirmation contains provisions purporting to modify the general terms and conditions of this Master Agreement (e.g. Events of Default, representations and warranties, set- off, etc.) in addition to provisions setting forth the commercial terms for the Transaction documented by such Confirmation (e.g., the notional volume, Fixed Price, Floating Price, etc.), no such Confirmation shall be deemed to effectively modify such general terms and conditions of this Master Agreement (with respect to the applicable Transaction or otherwise) unless it has been duly executed by both Parties hereto."
38
(5) GAAP. Section 3(d) of the Agreement is amended by adding in the last printed line thereof after the word "respect" and before the period following:

""Fallback Reference Dealers" means that: the Relevant Price will be determined and calculated as set forth in the definition "Commodity-Reference Dealers" (provided that, if the basis that the Specified Price for a Transaction is determined on an hourly basis, all references to Pricing Date shall be read as Pricing Hour) except that each party shall select, in good faith, a price quote from at least two (2) independent, impartial and unaffiliated Reference Dealers in the relevant market which satisfy all the criteria that a party applies generally at the time in deciding whether to offer or to make an extension of credit or to enter into a transaction comparable to the Transaction that is affected by the Market Disruption Event, and shall obtain such quotes within six (6) Business Days of the Market Disruption Event. The Relevant Price shall be the arithmetic mean of the prices so obtained, and such calculation shall be binding and conclusive absent manifest error even if one party was able to obtain only one quote or no quotes within the time provided. However, if the parties have not obtained at least two (2) prices in total on or before the sixth Business Day following the first Pricing Date on which the Market Disruption Event occurred or existed, the next applicable Disruption Fallback will apply to the Transaction."
Subject to the change in paragraph above, Section 7.5(d)(i) of the 2005 Commodity Definitions shall be applicable to all Transactions unless specified in a confirmation.
