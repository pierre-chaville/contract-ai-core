(2)Assessment and Understanding. It is capable of assessing the merits of and understanding (on its own behalf or through independent professional advice), and understands and accepts, the terms, conditions and risks of that Transaction. It is also capable of assuming, and assumes, the risks of that Transaction.

Part 5. Other Provisions.
(a)2006 ISDA Definitions. This Agreement is subject to the 2006 ISDA Definitions (the "Definitions") published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. as amended and supplemented from time to time.
In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of this Agreement and the Definitions, this Agreement will prevail. In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of any Confirmation and this Agreement or the Definitions, such Confirmation will prevail for the purposes of the relevant Transaction.
(b)Conditions to Certain Payments. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6(e)(i), if the amount referred to therein is a positive number, the Defaulting Party will pay such amount to the Non-defaulting Party, and if the amount referred to therein is a negative number, except to the extent set out below, the Non-defaulting Party shall have no obligation to pay any amount thereunder to the Defaulting Party unless and until the conditions set forth in (i) and (ii) below have been satisfied, at which time there shall arise an obligation of the Nondefaulting Party to pay to the Defaulting Party an amount equal to the absolute value of such negative number less any and all amounts which the Defaulting Patty may be obligated to pay under Section 11 (the "Conditional Payment Amount"):
(i)the Non-defaulting Party shall have received confirmation satisfactory to it in its sole discretion (which may include an unqualified opinion of its counsel) that (x) no further payments or deliveries under Section 2(a)(i) or 9(h) in respect of Terminated Transactions will be required to be made in accordance with Section 6(c)(ii) and (y) each Specified Transaction shall have terminated pursuant to its specified
6  ISDA® 2002
termination date or through the exercise by a party of a right to terminate and all obligations owing under each such Specified Transaction shall have been fully and finally performed;
(ii)all obligations (contingent or absolute, matured or unmatured) of the Defaulting Party and any Affiliate of the Defaulting Party to make any payment or delivery to the Non-defaulting Party or any Affiliate of the Non-defaulting Party shall have been fully and finally performed; provided that if the Conditional Payment Amount exceeds the aggregate amount of the obligations owing to the Non-defaulting Party and Affiliates of the Non-defaulting Party by the Defaulting Party and Affiliates of the Defaulting Party (including without limitation all obligations owing under each Specified Transaction), the Non-defaulting Party shall pay the amount of the excess to the Defaulting Party.
(c)Additional Line of Business Representation of Party B. Party B represents to Party A on and as of the date hereof and on each date on which a Transaction is entered into among them that:
(i)it has entered into this Agreement (including each Transaction evidenced hereby) in conjunction with its line of business or the financing of its business; and
(ii)all Transactions effected under this Agreement (x) will be appropriate in the conduct and management of its business; (y) will be entered into for nonspeculative purposes; and (z) constitute transactions entered into for purposes of hedging or managing risks related to its assets or liabilities as currently owned or incurred, or likely to be owned or incurred in the conduct of its business.
(d)Bankruptcy Code. The parties hereto intend that this Agreement shall be a "swap agreement" for purposes of 11 U.S.C. § 101(53B) and 12 U.S.C. § 1821(e)(8)(D)(vii), or any successor provisions.
(e)Escrow. If by reason of the time difference between the cities in which payments are to be made or otherwise, it is not possible for simultaneous payments to be made on any date on which both parties are required to make payments hereunder, either party may at its option and in its sole discretion notify the other party that payments on that date are to be made in escrow. In this case deposit of the payment due earlier on that date shall be made by 2:00 p.m. (local time at the place for the earlier payment) on that date with an escrow agent selected by the party giving the notice and reasonably acceptable to the other party, accompanied by irrevocable payment instructions
(a) to release the deposited payment to the intended recipient upon receipt by the escrow agent of the required deposit of the corresponding payment from the other party on the same date accompanied by irrevocable payment instructions to the same effect or (b) if the required deposit of the corresponding payment is not made on that same date, to return the payment deposited to the party that paid it into escrow. The party that elects to have payments made in escrow shall pay the costs of the escrow arrangements and shall cause those arrangements to provide that the intended recipient of the payment due to be deposited first shall be entitled to interest on that deposited payment for each day in the period of its deposit at the rate offered by the escrow agent for that day for overnight deposits in the relevant currency in the office where it holds that deposited payment (at 11:00 a.m. local time on that day) if that payment is not released by 5:00 p.m. local time on the date it is deposited for any reason other than the intended recipient's failure to make the escrow deposit it is required to make hereunder in a timely fashion.
(f)Dodd-Frank.
(i)Consent to Disclosure for Dodd-Frank Reporting. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or in any non-disclosure, confidentiality or similar agreement between the parties, each
7  ISDA® 2002
party consents to the disclosure of information to the extent required by the CFTC's regulations in Parts 43, 45, and 46 ("CFTC Reporting Regulations"), which mandate reporting of information regarding Transactions and similar information. Each party acknowledges that disclosures made pursuant to these regulations may include, without limitation, the disclosure of trade information including a party's identity (by name, identifier or otherwise) to a swap data repository ("SDR") and relevant regulators and that such disclosures could result in certain anonymous Transaction and pricing data becoming available to the public. For purposes of complying with the reporting obligations under the CFTC Reporting Regulations, each party further acknowledges that an SDR may engage the services of a global trade repository regulated by one or more governmental regulators, provided that such regulated global trade repository is subject to comparable confidentiality provisions as is an SDR registered with the CFTC. For avoidance of doubt, to the extent that applicable non-disclosure, confidentiality, bank secrecy or other law imposes non-disclosure requirements on information regarding Transactions and similar information required to be disclosed pursuant to the CFTC Regulations but permits a party to waive such requirements by consent, the consent and acknowledgements provided by such party in this Part 5(j)(ii) shall be a consent by it for purposes of such other applicable law.
(ii)Dodd-Frank Reporting. Party A will act as the "reporting counterparty" as required by Parts 43, 45 and 46 of Title 17, Chapter 1 of the CFTC's regulations for all Transactions under this Agreement.
(iii)End-User Exception. Party B represents to Party A that it elects not to clear any Transactions subject to a mandatory clearing determination under Section 2(h) of the Act and represents at the time of each Transaction that:
(A)it has made an annual election including the information listed in Regulation 50.50(b)(1)(iii) in a filing made pursuant to Regulation 50.50(b)(2), no more than 365 days prior to entering into such Transaction, such information has been amended as necessary to reflect any material changes thereto, and such annual filing covers such Transaction; or
(B)it has requested that Party A, and hereby authorizes Party A to, make a Swap-by-Swap election in a filing made pursuant to Regulation 50.50(b)(1)(iii); and
(a)it is not a "financial entity" as defined in Section 2(h)(7)(C)(i) of the Act, and under any successor statute or rule, as applicable, including those enacted pursuant to Dodd Frank,
(b)it is using such Transaction to hedge or mitigate commercial risk as provided in Regulation 50.50(c),
(c)it represents to Party A that it has not reported the information listed in Regulation 50.50(b)(1)(iii) in an annual filing described above, and
(d)it has provided to Party A all information listed in Regulation 50.50(b)(1)(iii) and such information is true, accurate and complete in every material respect and covers such Transaction, and
8  ISDA® 2002
(e)it generally meets it financial obligations associated with entering into non-cleared Transactions; and
(C)  if Party B is an entity that is an issuer of securities registered under Section 12 of, or is required to file reports under Section 15(d) of, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, an appropriate committee of Party B's board of directors (or equivalent body) has reviewed and approved Party B's decision to enter into swaps that are exempt from the transaction clearing requirement under Section 2(h)(1) of the Act and the exchange trading requirement under Section 2(h)(8) of the Act and such review and approval is described in the books and records of Party B, copies of which shall be made available to Party A upon request.
(iv)Municipal Advisor Role. Party B is not, and does not act on behalf of, either a "municipal entity" or "obligated person" (in each case as defined in Section 15B of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules adopted by the SEC with respect to municipal advisor registration).
(g)Generic Risk Disclosure for Financial Transactions and Related Transactions. Party B represents that it has read and fully understands this paragraph. As is common with many other financial instruments and transactions, over-the-counter derivative transactions, including, but not limited to, Financial Transactions, in addition to providing significant benefits, may in certain cases involve a variety of significant risks some, but not all of, which are described in this paragraph. Party B acknowledges that before entering into any Financial Transaction, Party B shall have carefully considered whether such transaction is appropriate in light of Party B's objectives, experience, financial and operational resources, and other relevant circumstances. Party B also acknowledges that it fully understands the nature and extent of its exposure to risk of loss, if any, which in some circumstances may significantly exceed the amount of any initial payment made to or by Party B. Financial Transactions permit precise customization to accomplish particular financial and risk management objectives that might otherwise be unachievable. The specific risks presented by a particular transaction necessarily depend upon the terms of that transaction and Party B's circumstances. Common to all, however, is their nature as legally binding contractual commitments, which, once agreed to, cannot be altered other than by termination or modification upon written agreement by the parties. Party B understands that such termination or modification may, in certain circumstances, result in significant losses and may include additional amounts required to be paid by Party B to cover relevant costs. As in any financial transaction, Party B understands the requirements, if any, applicable to Party B that are established by regulators or by Party B's board of directors or other governing body. Party B should also consider the legal, tax, accounting, and economic implications of entering into any Financial Transaction, independently, and if necessary, through consultation with such advisors as may be appropriate to assist it in understanding the risks involved.
(h)Basis Risk Disclosure. Party B represents that it understands that, to the extent the purpose of a Transaction is to hedge risks associated with a financial instrument through the use of an index or other financial instrument, Party A makes no representation that the index used by Party B to hedge its financial risk is the same as the underlying financial risk which Party B seeks to mitigate or hedge. For example, to the extent that Party B seeks to synthetically fix the rate of interest on a Loan which bears interest by reference to a variable rate of interest (the "Underlying Variable Rate"), the Floating Rate specified in the applicable Confirmation may not be based on the same index as the Underlying Variable Rate and, therefore, may not act as a perfect hedge against interest rate or basis risk. Party A makes no representations or warranties that the Floating Rate will match the Underlying Variable Rate.

(i)WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL: EACH PARTY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY CREDIT SUPPORT DOCUMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTY HAVE ENTERED INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY CREDIT SUPPORT DOCUMENT, AS APPLICABLE, IN RELIANCE ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS IN THIS SECTION.
(j)Additional Definitions. The following definitions shall be added to Section 14 in their appropriate alphabetical place:
"Credit Agreement" means any loan agreement, credit agreement, bond purchase agreement, covenant agreement, letter of credit application and/or reimbursement agreement, standby bond purchase agreement or other liquidity facility, promissory note, or other agreement, instrument or document, of whatever nature, under which Party A extends one or more loans or credit of any nature to Party B or for the benefit of Party B (collectively with any promissory notes, security agreements, pledge agreements or mortgages executed in connection with the foregoing, as amended, supplemented, restated or replaced from time to time, but without giving effect to any amendments, supplements, restatements or replacements thereto, or any waivers or consents granted thereunder, not consented to by Party A). The term "Credit Agreement" shall include any and all of the foregoing regardless of whether there are parties in addition to Party B and Party A to such agreement, instrument, or document.
"Derivative Transaction" means (a) any transaction which is a rate swap transaction, basis swap, forward rate transaction, commodity swap, commodity option, equity or equity index swap, equity or equity index option, bond option, interest rate option, foreign exchange transaction, cap transaction, floor transaction, collar transaction, currency swap transaction, cross- currency rate swap transaction, currency option or any other similar transaction (including any option with respect to any of these transactions) and (b) any combination of these transactions.
"Loan" has the meaning set out in the Credit Agreement but does not include a Transaction under this Agreement.
"Loan Documents" has the meaning set out in the Credit Agreement but does not include this Agreement.
(k)Incorporation of Covenants.
(i)Party B shall provide Party A at all times hereunder with the same covenant protection as Party B provides its lenders or creditors under the Credit Agreement. Therefore, in addition to the cross default provisions of this Agreement, and notwithstanding the satisfaction of any obligation or promise to pay money to its lenders or creditors under the Credit Agreement, or the termination or cancellation of the Credit Agreement, Party B hereby agrees to perform, comply with and observe for the benefit of Party A hereunder all affirmative and negative covenants contained in the Credit Agreement applicable to Party B (excluding any obligation or promise to pay money under the Credit Agreement) at any time Party B has any obligation (whether absolute or contingent) under this Agreement.
(ii)For purposes hereof: (A) the affirmative and negative covenants of the Credit Agreement applicable to Party B (together with related definitions and ancillary provisions, but in any event excluding any obligation or promise to pay money under the Credit Agreement) are incorporated by reference herein (mutatis mutandis); (B) if lenders or creditors other than Party A are parties to the Credit Agreement,
10  ISDA® 2002
then references therein to the lenders or creditors shall be deemed references to Party A; and (C) for any such covenant applying only when any loan, other extension of credit, obligation or commitment under the Credit Agreement is outstanding, that covenant shall be deemed to apply hereunder at any time Party B has any obligation (whether absolute or contingent) under this Agreement.
(iii)Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the incorporation of any provision by reference from the Credit Agreement would result in the violation by Party B of the terms of the Credit Agreement, or be in violation of any law, rule or regulation (as interpreted by any court of competent jurisdiction), then this Agreement shall not incorporate that provision.
(l)Credit Agreement.
(i)Insofar as any provisions of the Credit Agreement incorporated herein conflict with or are inconsistent with any terms, covenants or conditions in this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall prevail with respect to the subject matter hereof to the extent of the conflict or inconsistency, provided that the non-inclusion of a provision in either document shall not constitute a conflict or inconsistency for the purposes of this provision.
(ii)Words and expressions defined in the Credit Agreement and not otherwise defined in this Agreement are incorporated into this Agreement by reference.
The parties acknowledge and agree that such definitions shall continue to be effective notwithstanding that the Credit Agreement has been amended or has otherwise ceased to be of effect. Any definitions or provisions incorporated from the Credit Agreement continue to be incorporated herein on the terms set out in the Credit Agreement immediately before its expiration or termination.
