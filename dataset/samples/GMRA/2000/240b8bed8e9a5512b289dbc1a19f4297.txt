any consequential or indirect damages, opportunity costs or lost profits, even if expressly advised, or otherwise aware, of the possibility of such damages.
4. 	 Netting of Payments and Deliveries.
As specified in the Agreement and for the avoidance of doubt, it is the intent of the parties hereto that all cash amounts payable in the same currency on the same day hereunder, whether as Income, cash proceeds of redemption of Purchased Securities included in the definition of Equivalent Securities, Purchase Price, Repurchase Price, Cash Margin or otherwise, should be netted off, and thus, if on any date amounts would otherwise be payable in the same currency by each party to the other, then, on such date, each party's obligation to make payment of any such amount will be automatically satisfied and discharged and, if the aggregate amount that would otherwise be payable by one party exceeds the aggregate amount that would otherwise be payable by the other party, replaced by an obligation of the party with the larger aggregate amount payable to pay the other party the excess of the larger aggregate amount over the smaller aggregate amount.
It is the intent of the parties that if one Repurchase Transaction is maturing and another Repurchase Transaction with respect to the same Purchased Securities is commencing on the same day, the Buyer is authorised to retain the Purchased Securities for the maturing Transaction to the extent necessary to satisfy the obligation of the Seller to deliver Purchased Securities in respect of the new Transaction.
5. 	 Tax treatment of Transaction.
The parties agree to treat all Transactions under this Agreement as loans from Party A to FS Investment Corporation for federal, state and local income and franchise tax purposes.
6. 	 General
(a) A failure or delay in exercising any right, power or privilege in respect of this Agreement will not be presumed to operate as a waiver, and a single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege will not be presumed to preclude any subsequent or further exercise, of that right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.
(b) In the event of any discrepancy between this Agreement and the preprinted terms of the Global Master Repurchase Agreement 2000 Version published by The Bond Market Association and ISMA (the "TBMA") the terms of the TBMA shall prevail.
