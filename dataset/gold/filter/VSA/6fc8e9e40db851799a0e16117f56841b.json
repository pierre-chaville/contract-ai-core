      "explanation": "The preamble of the CSA typically includes the title, reference to the ISDA Master Agreement, date, and identification of the parties.

      "explanation": "The Annex for a New York law CSA begins at 'Paragraph 13. Elections and Variables' (line 11) and continues through the negotiated terms, ending at the signature block ('[Signature Page Follows]', line 206). This matches the standard structure for a New York law CSA, where Paragraph 13 is the negotiated annex. The preceding lines (10 and before) are standard incorporation language, and after line 206 is the signature and exhibits."
