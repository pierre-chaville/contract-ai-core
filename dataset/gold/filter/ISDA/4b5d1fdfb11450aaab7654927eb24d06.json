      "explanation": "Lines 3-193 comprise the full Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement, starting with the heading 'SCHEDULE to the ISDA 2002 Master Agreement' and ending just before the execution signatures. The content includes all the negotiated terms and elections typical of an ISDA Schedule, and there is no indication of standard pre-printed text or annexes such as a Credit Support Annex (CSA) within this span. The lines before 3 are cover/exhibit references, and lines after 193 are execution blocks and signatures."
