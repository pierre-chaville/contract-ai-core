      "explanation": "The ISDA Schedule begins at line 264 (\"SCHEDULE\") and continues through the signature page at line 515. This span includes all the parts of the Schedule (Parts 1-6), including elections, definitions, notice information, and modifications, and excludes the standard pre-printed Master Agreement and any annexes such as the CSA. The content is contiguous and matches the user's request to filter for the Schedule only."
