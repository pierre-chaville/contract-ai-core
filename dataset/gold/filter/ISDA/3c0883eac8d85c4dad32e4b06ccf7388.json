      "explanation": "The ISDA Schedule begins at line 252 (\"SCHEDULE to the ISDA Master Agreement\") and continues through the signature page at line 440. This section contains all the negotiated terms, elections, and modifications to the standard ISDA Master Agreement, and is clearly demarcated from the standard pre-printed form and any annexes. The content matches the user's request to filter for the Schedule only."
