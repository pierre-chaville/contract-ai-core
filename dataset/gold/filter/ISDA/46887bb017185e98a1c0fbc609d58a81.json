      "explanation": "The ISDA Master Agreement Schedule begins at line 350 (\"SCHEDULE\") and continues through the end of the schedule's terms, which is line 464 (\"[Remainder of Page Intentionally Left Blank.]\"). This span includes all the negotiated terms between the parties and excludes the standard pre-printed Master Agreement, definitions, and any annexes such as the CSA. The signature block for the schedule follows at line 465, but the substantive schedule content is lines 350-464."
