The content before line 7 is cover/title, and after line 220 is the Confirmation and not part of the Schedule. The Schedule typically ends with the execution/signature blocks, which are at lines 207-220. This span excludes the standard pre-print, CSA annexes, and the swap confirmation that follows."
