136: (b) Severability. Except as otherwise provided in Sections 5(b)(i) or 5(b)(ii) of this Agreement in the event that any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement should be held invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

The party that elects to have payments made in escrow shall pay the costs of the escrow arrangements and shall cause those arrangements to provide that the intended recipient of the payment due to be deposited first shall be entitled to interest on that deposited payment for each day in the period of its deposit at the rate offered by the escrow agent for that day for overnight deposits in the relevant currency in the office where
