Definitions.  This Agreement, including each Confirmation and each Swap Transaction, is subject to the 2000 ISDA Definitions, as amended, supplemented, updated, and superseded from time to time (the "Definitions"), as published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc.
("ISDA") and will be governed in all respects by the Definitions (except that references to "Swap Transactions" shall be deemed to be references to "Transactions"). The Definitions are incorporated by reference in, and made part of, this Agreement and each Confirmation as if set forth in full in this Agreement and such Confirmations. In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of this Agreement and the Definitions, this Agreement will prevail (and, in the event of any inconsistency between any Confirmation and the Definitions, the Confirmation will control).

(b)
Downgrade Provisions.

It shall be a collateralization event ("Collateralization Event ") if (A) either (i) the unsecured, long-term senior debt obligations of Party A are rated below "A1" by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.

For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereby acknowledge and agree that notwithstanding the occurrence of a Collateralization Event, this Agreement and each Transaction hereunder shall continue to be as a Swap Agreement for purposes of the Trust Agreement.  Within 30 days from the date a Collateralization Event has occurred and so long as such Collateralization Event is continuing, Party A shall, at its sole expense, either (i) post collateral according to the terms of an ISDA 1994 New York Law Credit Support Annex, which shall receive prior written confirmation from each of the Rating Agencies (as defined in the Trust Agreement)  that their then-current ratings of the Offered Certificates and the Class B Certificates will not be downgraded or withdrawn by such Rating Agency (the "Rating Agency Condition "), or (ii) obtain a substitute counterparty that (a) is reasonably acceptable to Party B and satisfies the Rating Agency Condition, (b) satisfies the Hedge Counterparty Ratings Requirement (as defined herein) and (c) assumes the obligations of Party A under this Agreement (through an assignment and assumption agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Party B) or replaces the outstanding Transactions hereunder with transactions on identical terms, except that Party A shall be replaced as counterparty, provided that such substitute counterparty, as of the date of such assumption or replacement, will not, as a result thereof, be required to withhold or deduct on account of tax under the Agreement or the new transactions, as applicable, and such assumption or replacement will not lead to a termination event or event of default occurring under the Agreement or new transactions, as applicable.
(2)
It shall be a ratings event ("Ratings Event ") if at any time after the date hereof Party A shall fail to satisfy the Hedge Counterparty Ratings Threshold.  Hedge Counterparty Ratings Threshold shall mean (A) the unsecured,  long-term senior debt obligations of Party A are rated at least "BBB-" by S&P, (B) either (i) the unsecured, long-term senior debt obligations of Party A are rated at least "A2" by Moody's (and such rating is not on watch for possible downgrade to below "A2") and the unsecured, short-term debt obligations of Party A are rated at least "P-1" by Moody's (and such rating is not on watch for possible downgrade to below "P-1") or (ii) if Party A does not have a short-term rating from Moody's, the unsecured, long-term senior debt obligations of Party A are rated at least "A1" by Moody's, and (C) either
(i) the unsecured, senior debt obligations or financial strength ratings of Party A , are rated at least "A" by Fitch or (ii) the unsecured, short-term debt obligations (if any) of Party A , are rated at least "F1" by Fitch.

(C) assumes the obligations of Party A under this Agreement (through an assignment and assumption agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Party B) or replaces the outstanding Transactions hereunder with transactions on identical terms, except that Party A shall be replaced as counterparty, provided that such substitute counterparty, as of the date of such assumption or replacement, will not, as a result thereof, be required to withhold or deduct on account of tax under the Agreement or the new transactions, as applicable, and such assumption or replacement will not lead to a termination event or event of default occurring under the Agreement or new transactions, as applicable, and (ii) be required to post collateral as set forth in (b) below;
(b)
If Party A has not obtained a substitute counterparty as set forth in (3)(a) above within 30 days (or, in the case of a failure to meet the requirements of subparagraph (A) of the definition of "Hedge Counterparty Ratings Threshold", within 15 Business Days) of the Ratings Event and the Ratings Event is continuing, then Party A shall continue to seek a substitute counterparty and, on or prior to the expiration of such period, post collateral according to the terms of an ISDA 1994 New York Law Credit Support Annex.  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if Party A is required to transfer its rights and obligations under this Agreement pursuant to this Part 5(b)(3) as a result of a rating issued by S&P, Party A shall, prior to such transfer, be required to post collateral in accordance with (i) the terms of an ISDA 1994 New York Law Credit Support Annex or (ii) an agreement with Party B providing for the posting of collateral, which agreement shall satisfy the Rating Agency Condition and require Party A to post the required collateral.
Hedge Counterparty Ratings Requirement shall mean (a) either (i) the unsecured, short-term debt obligations of the substitute counterparty (or its Credit Support Provider) are rated at least "A-1" by S&P or (ii) if the substitute counterparty does not have a short-term rating from S&P, the unsecured, long-term senior debt obligations of the substitute counterparty (or its Credit Support Provider) are rated at least "A+" by S&P, (b) either
(i) the unsecured, long-term senior debt obligations of such substitute counterparty (or its Credit Support Provider) are rated at least "A1" by Moody's (and if rated "A1" by Moody's, such rating is not on watch for possible downgrade to below "A1") and the unsecured, short-term debt obligations of such substitute counterparty (or its Credit Support Provider) are rated at least "P-1" by Moody's (and if rated "P-1" by Moody's, such rating is not on watch for possible downgrade and remaining on watch for possible downgrade), or (ii) if such substitute counterparty (or its Credit Support Provider) does not have a short-term debt rating from Moody's, the unsecured, long-term senior debt obligations of such substitute counterparty (or its Credit Support Provider) are rated at least "Aa3" by Moody's (and if rated "Aa3" by Moody's, such rating is not on watch for possible downgrade to below "Aa3"), and (c) either (i) the unsecured, long-term senior debt obligations of such substitute counterparty (or its Credit Support Provider) are rated at least "A" by Fitch or (ii) the unsecured, short-term debt obligations of such substitute counterparty (or its Credit Support Provider) are rated at least "F1" by Fitch. For the purpose of this definition, no direct or indirect recourse against one or more shareholders of the substitute counterparty (or against any Person in control of, or controlled by, or under common control with, any such shareholder) shall be deemed to constitute a guarantee, security or support of the obligations of the substitute counterparty.
