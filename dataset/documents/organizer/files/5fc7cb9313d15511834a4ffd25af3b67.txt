The Confirmation shall describe the Purchased Securities (including CUSIP or ISIN or other identifying number or numbers, if any), identify Buyer and Seller and set forth -
(i) 	 the Purchase Date;
(ii) 	 the Purchase Price;
(iii) 	 the Repurchase Date, unless the Transaction is to be terminable on demand (in which case the Confirmation shall state that it is terminable on demand);
(iv) 	 the Pricing Rate applicable to the Transaction;
(v) 	 in respect of each party the details of the bank account[s] to which payments to be made hereunder are to be credited;
(vi) 	 where the Buy/Sell Back Annex applies, whether the Transaction is a Repurchase Transaction or a Buy/Sell Back Transaction;

(viii) 	 any additional terms or conditions of the Transaction;
and may be in the form of Annex II hereto or may be in any other form to which the parties agree.
The Confirmation relating to a Transaction shall, together with this Agreement, constitute prima facie evidence of the terms agreed between Buyer and Seller for that Transaction, unless objection is made with respect to the Confirmation promptly after receipt thereof. In the event of any conflict between the terms of such Confirmation and this Agreement, the Confirmation shall prevail in respect of that Transaction and those terms only.
(c) 	 On the Purchase Date for a Transaction, Seller shall transfer the Purchased Securities to Buyer or its agent against the payment of the Purchase Price by Buyer.
(d) 	 Termination of a Transaction will be effected, in the case of on demand Transactions, on the date specified for Termination in such demand, and, in the case of fixed term Transactions, on the date fixed for Termination.
(e) 	 In the case of on demand Transactions, demand for Termination shall be made by Buyer or Seller, by telephone or otherwise, and shall provide for Termination to occur after not less than the minimum period as is customarily required for the settlement or delivery of money or Equivalent Securities of the relevant kind.
(f) 	 On the Repurchase Date, Buyer shall transfer to Seller or its agent Equivalent Securities against the payment of the Repurchase Price by Seller (less any amount then payable and unpaid by Buyer to Seller pursuant to paragraph 5).
4\. Margin Maintenance
(a) 	 If at any time either party has a Net Exposure in respect of the other party it may by notice to the other party require the other party to make a Margin Transfer to it of an aggregate amount or value at least equal to that Net Exposure.
(b) 	 A notice under sub paragraph (a) above may be given orally or in writing.
(c) 	 For the purposes of this Agreement a party has a Net Exposure in respect of the other party if the aggregate of all the first party's Transaction Exposures plus any amount payable to the first party under paragraph 5 but unpaid less the amount of any Net Margin provided to the first party exceeds the aggregate of all the other party's Transaction Exposures plus any amount payable to the other party under paragraph 5 but unpaid less the amount of any Net Margin provided to the other party; and the amount of the Net Exposure is the amount of the excess. For this purpose any amounts not denominated in the Base Currency shall be converted into the Base Currency at the Spot Rate prevailing at the relevant time.
(d) 	 To the extent that a party calling for a Margin Transfer has previously paid Cash Margin which has not been repaid or delivered Margin Securities in respect of which Equivalent Margin Securities have not been delivered to it, that party shall be entitled to require that such Margin Transfer be satisfied first by the repayment of such Cash Margin or the delivery of Equivalent Margin Securities but, subject to this, the composition of a Margin Transfer shall be at the option of the party making such Margin Transfer.
(e) 	 Any Cash Margin transferred shall be in the Base Currency or such other currency as the parties may agree.
(f) 	 A payment of Cash Margin shall give rise to a debt owing from the party receiving such payment to the party making such payment. Such debt shall bear interest at such rate, payable at such times, as may be specified in Annex I hereto in respect of the relevant currency or otherwise agreed between the parties, and shall be repayable subject to the terms of this Agreement.
(g) 	 Where Seller or Buyer becomes obliged under sub paragraph (a) above to make a Margin Transfer, it shall transfer Cash Margin or Margin Securities or Equivalent Margin Securities within the minimum period specified in Annex I hereto or, if no period is there specified, such minimum period as is customarily required for the settlement or delivery of money, Margin Securities or Equivalent Margin Securities of the relevant kind.
(h) 	 The parties may agree that, with respect to any Transaction, the provisions of sub-paragraphs (a) to (g) above shall not apply but instead that margin may be provided separately in respect of that Transaction in which case
(i) 	 that Transaction shall not be taken into account when calculating whether either party has a Net Exposure;
(ii) 	 margin shall be provided in respect of that Transaction in such manner as the parties may agree; and
(iii) 	 margin provided in respect of that Transaction shall not be taken into account for the purposes of sub paragraphs (a) to (g) above.
(i) 	 The parties may agree that any Net Exposure which may arise shall be eliminated not by Margin Transfers under the preceding provisions of this paragraph but by the repricing of Transactions under sub paragraph (j) below, the adjustment of Transactions under sub - paragraph (k) below or a combination of both these methods.
(j) 	 Where the parties agree that a Transaction is to be repriced under this sub paragraph, such repricing shall be effected as follows -
(i) 	 the Repurchase Date under the relevant Transaction (the "original Transaction") shall be deemed to occur on the date on which the repricing is to be effected (the "Repricing Date");
(ii) 	 the parties shall be deemed to have entered into a new Transaction (the "Repriced Transaction") on the terms set out in (iii) to (vi) below;
(iii) 	 the Purchased Securities under the Repriced Transaction shall be Securities equivalent to the Purchased Securities under the Original Transaction;
(iv) 	 the Purchase Date under the Repriced Transaction shall be the Repricing Date;
(v) 	 the Purchase Price under the Repriced Transaction shall be such amount as shall, when multiplied by the Margin Ratio applicable to the Original Transaction, be equal to the Market Value of such Securities on the Repricing Date;
(vi) 	 the Repurchase Date, the Pricing Rate, the Margin Ratio and, subject as aforesaid, the other terms of the Repriced Transaction shall be identical to those of the Original Transaction;
(vii) 	 the obligations of the parties with respect to the delivery of the Purchased Securities and the payment of the Purchase Price under the Repriced Transaction shall be set off against their obligations with respect to the delivery of Equivalent Securities and payment of the Repurchase Price under the Original Transaction and accordingly only a net cash sum shall be paid by one party to the other. Such net cash sum shall be paid within the period specified in sub paragraph (g) above.
(k) 	 The adjustment of a Transaction (the "Original Transaction") under this sub paragraph shall be effected by the parties agreeing that on the date on which the adjustment is to be made (the "Adjustment Date") the Original Transaction shall be terminated and they shall enter into a new Transaction (the "Replacement Transaction") in accordance with the following provisions
(i) 	 the Original Transaction shall be terminated on the Adjustment Date on such terms as the parties shall agree on or before the Adjustment Date;
(ii) 	 the Purchased Securities under the Replacement Transaction shall be such Securities as the parties shall agree on or before the Adjustment Date (being Securities the aggregate Market Value of which at the Adjustment Date is substantially equal to the Repurchase Price under the Original Transaction at the Adjustment Date multiplied by the Margin Ratio applicable to the Original Transaction);
(iii) 	 the Purchase Date under the Replacement Transaction shall be the Adjustment Date;
(iv) 	 the other terms of the Replacement Transaction shall be such as the parties shall agree on or before the Adjustment Date; and
(v) 	 the obligations of the parties with respect to payment and delivery of Securities on the Adjustment Date under the Original Transaction and the Replacement Transaction shall be settled in accordance with paragraph 6 within the minimum period specified in sub paragraph (g) above.
5\. Income Payments
Unless otherwise agreed -
(i) 	 where the Term of a particular Transaction extends over an Income Payment Date in respect of any Securities subject to that Transaction, Buyer shall on the date such Income is paid by the issuer transfer to or credit to the account of Seller an amount equal to (and in the same currency as) the amount paid by the issuer;
(ii) 	 where Margin Securities are transferred from one party ("the first party") to the other party ("the second party") and an Income Payment Date in respect of such Securities occurs before Equivalent Margin Securities are transferred by the second party to the first party, the second party shall on the date such Income is paid by the issuer transfer to or credit to the account of the first party an amount equal to (and in the same currency as) the amount paid by the issuer;
and for the avoidance of doubt references in this paragraph to the amount of any Income paid by the issuer of any Securities shall be to an amount paid without any withholding or deduction for or on account of taxes or duties notwithstanding that a payment of such Income made in certain circumstances may be subject to such a withholding or deduction.
6\. Payment and Transfer
(a) 	  Unless otherwise agreed, all money paid hereunder shall be in immediately available freely convertible funds of the relevant currency. All Securities to be transferred hereunder (i) shall be in suitable form for transfer and shall be accompanied by duly executed instruments of transfer or assignment in blank (where required for transfer) and
such other documentation as the transferee may reasonably request, or (ii) shall be transferred through the book entry system of Euroclear or Clearstream, or (iii) shall be transferred through any other agreed securities clearance system or (iv) shall be transferred by any other method mutually acceptable to Seller and Buyer.
(b) 	 Unless otherwise agreed, all money payable by one party to the other in respect of any Transaction shall be paid free and clear of, and without withholding or deduction for, any taxes or duties of whatsoever nature imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any authority having power to tax, unless the withholding or deduction of such taxes or duties is required by law. In that event, unless otherwise agreed, the paying party shall pay such additional amounts as will result in the net amounts receivable by the other party (after taking account of such withholding or deduction) being equal to such amounts as would have been received by it had no such taxes or duties been required to be withheld or deducted.
(c) 	 Unless otherwise agreed in writing between the parties, under each Transaction transfer of Purchased Securities by Seller and payment of Purchase Price by Buyer against the transfer of such Purchased Securities shall be made simultaneously and transfer of Equivalent Securities by Buyer and payment of Repurchase Price payable by Seller against the transfer of such Equivalent Securities shall be made simultaneously.
(d) 	 Subject to and without prejudice to the provisions of sub paragraph 6(c), either party may from time to time in accordance with market practice and in recognition of the practical difficulties in arranging simultaneous delivery of Securities and money waive in relation to any Transaction its rights under this Agreement to receive simultaneous transfer and/or payment provided that transfer and/or payment shall, notwithstanding such waiver, be made on the same day and provided also that no such waiver in respect of one Transaction shall affect or bind it in respect of any other Transaction.
(e) 	 The parties shall execute and deliver all necessary documents and take all necessary steps to procure that all right, title and interest in any Purchased Securities, any Equivalent Securities, any Margin Securities and any Equivalent Margin Securities shall pass to the party to which transfer is being made upon transfer of the same in accordance with this Agreement, free from all liens, claims, charges and encumbrances.
(f) 	 Notwithstanding the use of expressions such as "Repurchase Date ", "Repurchase Price ", "margin ", "Net Margin ", "Margin Ratio " and "substitution ", which are used to reflect terminology used in the market for transactions of the kind provided for in this Agreement, all right, title and interest in and to Securities and money transferred or paid under this Agreement shall pass to the transferee upon transfer or payment, the obligation of the party receiving Purchased Securities or Margin Securities being an obligation to transfer Equivalent Securities or Equivalent Margin Securities.
(g) 	 Time shall be of the essence in this Agreement.
(h) 	 Subject to paragraph 10, all amounts in the same currency payable by each party to the other under any Transaction or otherwise under this Agreement on the same date shall be combined in a single calculation of a net sum payable by one party to the other and the obligation to pay that sum shall be the only obligation of either party in respect of those amounts.
(i) 	 Subject to paragraph 10, all Securities of the same issue, denomination, currency and series, transferable by each party to the other under any Transaction or hereunder on the same date shall be combined in a single calculation of a net quantity of Securities transferable by one party to the other and the obligation to transfer the net quantity of Securities shall be the only obligation of either party in respect of the Securities so transferable and receivable.
(j) 	 If the parties have specified in Annex I hereto that this paragraph 6(j) shall apply, each obligation of a party under this Agreement (other than an obligation arising under paragraph 10) is subject to the condition precedent that none of those events specified in paragraph 10(a) which are identified in Annex I hereto for the purposes of this paragraph 6(j) (being events which, upon the serving of a Default Notice, would be an Event of Default with respect to the other party) shall have occurred and be continuing with respect to the other party.
7\. Contractual Currency
(a) 	 All the payments made in respect of the Purchase Price or the Repurchase Price of any Transaction shall be made in the currency of the Purchase Price (the "Contractual Currency") save as provided in paragraph 10(c)(ii). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the payee of any money may, at its option, accept tender thereof in any other currency, provided, however, that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the obligation of the payer to pay such money will be discharged only to the extent of the amount of the Contractual Currency that such payee may, consistent with normal banking procedures, purchase with such other currency (after deduction of any premium and costs of exchange) for delivery within the customary delivery period for spot transactions in respect of the relevant currency.
(b) 	 If for any reason the amount in the Contractual Currency received by a party, including amounts received after conversion of any recovery under any judgment or order expressed in a currency other than the Contractual Currency, falls short of the amount in the Contractual Currency due and payable, the party required to make the payment will, as a separate and independent obligation, to the extent permitted by applicable law, immediately transfer such additional amount in the Contractual Currency as may be necessary to compensate for the shortfall.
(c) 	 If for any reason the amount in the Contractual Currency received by a party exceeds the amount of the Contractual Currency due and payable, the party receiving the transfer will refund promptly the amount of such excess.
8\. Substitution
(a) 	 A Transaction may at any time between the Purchase Date and Repurchase Date, if Seller so requests and Buyer so agrees, be varied by the transfer by Buyer to Seller of Securities equivalent to the Purchased Securities, or to such of the Purchased Securities as shall be agreed, in exchange for the transfer by Seller to Buyer of other Securities of such amount and description as shall be agreed ("New Purchased Securities") (being Securities having a Market Value at the date of the variation at least equal to the Market Value of the Equivalent Securities transferred to Seller).
(b) 	 Any variation under sub paragraph (a) above shall be effected, subject to paragraph 6(d), by the simultaneous transfer of the Equivalent Securities and New Purchased Securities concerned.
(c) 	 A Transaction which is varied under sub paragraph (a) above shall thereafter continue in effect as though the Purchased Securities under that Transaction consisted of or included the New Purchased Securities instead of the Securities in respect of which Equivalent Securities have been transferred to Seller.
(d) 	 Where either party has transferred Margin Securities to the other party it may at any time before Equivalent Margin Securities are transferred to it under paragraph 4 request the other party to transfer Equivalent Margin Securities to it in exchange for the transfer to the other party of new Margin Securities having a Market Value at the time of transfer at least equal to that of such Equivalent Margin Securities. If the other party agrees to the request, the exchange shall be effected, subject to paragraph 6(d), by the simultaneous transfer of the Equivalent Margin Securities and new Margin Securities concerned. Where either or both of such transfers is or are effected through a settlement system in circumstances which under the rules and procedures of that settlement system give rise to a payment by or for the account of one party to or for the account of the other party, the parties shall cause such payment or payments to be made outside that settlement system, for value the same day as the payments made through that settlement system, as shall ensure that the exchange of Equivalent Margin Securities and new Margin Securities effected under this sub paragraph does not give rise to any net payment of cash by either party to the other.

(ii) 	 If by the Default Valuation Time the non-Defaulting Party has not given a Default Valuation Notice, the Default Market Value of the relevant Equivalent Securities or Equivalent Margin Securities shall be an amount equal to their Net Value at the Default Valuation Time; provided that, if at the Default Valuation Time the non-Defaulting Party reasonably determines that, owing to circumstances affecting the market in the Equivalent Securities or Equivalent Margin Securities in question, it is not possible for the non-Defaulting Party to determine a Net Value of such Equivalent Securities or Equivalent Margin Securities which is commercially reasonable, the Default Market Value of such Equivalent Securities or Equivalent Margin Securities shall be an amount equal to their Net Value as determined by the non-Defaulting Party as soon as reasonably practicable after the Default Valuation Time.

(ii) 	 if Buyer has a Transaction Exposure to Seller in respect of the relevant Transaction, require Seller from time to time to pay Cash Margin at least equal to such Transaction Exposure;

(i) 	 The provisions of this Agreement constitute a complete statement of the remedies available to each party in respect of any Event of Default.

(ii) 	 If the first party reasonably decides, instead of entering into such replacement transactions, to replace or unwind any hedging transactions which the first party entered into in connection with the Transaction so terminating, or to enter into any replacement hedging transactions, the other party shall be required to pay to the first party the amount determined by the first party in good faith to be equal to the loss or expense incurred in connection with entering into such replacement or unwinding (including all fees, costs and other expenses) less the amount of any profit or gain made by that party in connection with such replacement or unwinding; provided that if that calculation results in a negative number, an amount equal to that number shall be payable by the first party to the other party.
(l) 	 Each party shall immediately notify the other if an Event of Default, or an event which, upon the serving of a Default Notice, would be an Event of Default, occurs in relation to it.
11. 	 Tax Event
(a) 	 This paragraph shall apply if either party notifies the other that
(i) 	 any action taken by a taxing authority or brought in a court of competent jurisdiction (regardless of whether such action is taken or brought with respect to a party to this Agreement); or
(ii) 	 a change in the fiscal or regulatory regime (including, but not limited to, a change in law or in the general interpretation of law but excluding any change in any rate of tax), has or will, in the notifying party's reasonable opinion, have a material adverse effect on that party in the context of a Transaction.
(b) 	 If so requested by the other party, the notifying party will furnish the other with an opinion of a suitably qualified adviser that an event referred to in sub paragraph (a)(i) or (ii) above has occurred and affects the notifying party.
(c) 	 Where this paragraph applies, the party giving the notice referred to in sub paragraph (a) may, subject to sub paragraph (d) below, terminate the Transaction with effect from a date specified in the notice, not being earlier (unless so agreed by the other party) than 30 days after the date of the notice, by nominating that date as the Repurchase Date.
(d) 	 If the party receiving the notice referred to in sub paragraph (a) so elects, it may override that notice by giving a counter notice to the other party.

(e) 	 Where a Transaction is terminated as described in this paragraph, the party which has given the notice to terminate shall indemnify the other party against any reasonable legal and other professional expenses incurred by the other party by reason of the termination, but the other party may not claim any sum by way of consequential loss or damage in respect of a termination in accordance with this paragraph.
(f) 	 This paragraph is without prejudice to paragraph 6(b) (obligation to pay additional amounts if withholding or deduction required); but an obligation to pay such additional amounts may, where appropriate, be a circumstance which causes this paragraph to apply.

AMENDED AND RESTATED CONFIRMATION
The purpose of this amended and restated confirmation, dated as of February 6, 2013 (the "Confirmation " and such date, the "Amendment Date "), is to amend and restate the terms and conditions of the confirmation dated October 26, 2012, (the "Original Confirmation ") in respect of the terms of a series of repurchase transactions (each, a "Series Transaction") between JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, London branch ("JPMCB ") and Cobbs Creek LLC ("Cobbs Creek "). This confirmation supplements, forms a part of and is subject to the Global Master Repurchase Agreement, dated as of October 26, 2012, between JPMCB and Cobbs Creek (as amended on February 6, 2013 and as amended and supplemented further from time to time, the "Master Agreement ") and supersedes the Original Confirmation in its entirety.
Except as expressly modified hereby, all provisions contained in, or incorporated by reference into, the Master Agreement shall govern this Confirmation and the Series
Transactions. In the event of any inconsistencies between the Master Agreement and this Confirmation, this Confirmation will govern. This Confirmation shall become effective, and shall amend and restate the Original Confirmation, in each case as of the Amendment Date. Capitalised terms not defined herein have the meaning ascribed to them in the Master Agreement.

The Seller shall deliver the Purchased Securities on each Purchase Date; and the Buyer will purchase the Purchased Securities on each such Purchase Date, subject only to (i) no Series Transaction having previously been terminated due to an Event of Default and (ii) unless the Buyer, in its sole discretion, waives such condition, the condition that no Excess Paydown Event have occurred.   On each date (each, a "Ramp-up Date ") during the term of this Confirmation on which the CLO Issuer increases the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the CLO Notes, subject to prior notice from the Seller to the Buyer of the occurrence of the relevant Ramp-up Date, the parties shall enter into an additional Series Transaction with respect to which the Purchased Securities will be the CLO Notes to the extent of such increase and for which the Purchase Date will be the Ramp-up Date. Seller shall deliver a total of $360,000,000 of Purchased Securities to Buyer on or before July 24, 2013.
Excess Paydown Event: 	    	    An Excess Paydown Event will occur if on any Purchase Date the aggregate amount of principal payments with respect to the CLO Notes since the initial Purchase Date (including payments on that Purchase Date) exceeds the "Reduction Threshold" set forth below for the relevant period Reduction Threshold 	    	    Period from but excluding 	    	    To and including the Repurchase Date in 	    	 Reduction Threshold initial Purchase Date 	    	 February 2015 	    	 USD 0.00 the Repurchase Date in February 2015 	    	 August 2015 	    	 USD51,000,000 the Repurchase Date in August 2015 	    	 February 2016 	    	 USD102,000,000 the Repurchase Date in February 2016 	    	 August 2016 	    	 USD153,000,000 the Repurchase Date in August 2016 	    	 February 2017 	    	 USD204,000,000 CLO Closing Date 	    	 The "Closing Date" as defined on the CLO Indenture.

Final Purchase Date: 	    	  The CLO Payment Date falling in November 2016; unless the Final Repurchase Date occurs prior to the Scheduled Final Repurchase Date (in which case the Final Purchase Date will be the Purchase Date preceding the Final Repurchase Date).
Final Repurchase Date 	    	  The final Repurchase Date, which will be the earlier of:   (a) the date on which the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the CLO Notes, after giving effect to principal payments on that date, is equal to zero; and   (b) the CLO Payment Date falling in February 2017 (the "Scheduled Final Repurchase Date ").
Purchase Price: 	    	 For any Purchase Date, (i) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the CLO Notes divided by the Margin Ratio (equating to a Purchase Price at 83.333333% of outstanding principal amount of the CLO Notes), or (ii) solely in the case of a Purchase Date resulting from a Ramp-up Date, the relevant increase in the outstanding principal amount of the CLO Notes divided by the Margin Ratio (equating to a Purchase Price at 83.333333% of the increase in the outstanding principal amount of the CLO Notes).
Margin Ratio: 	    	 120%.
Contractual Currency: 	    	 USD Repurchase Date: 	    	    (A) For any Series Transaction outstanding on the Amendment Date, the Amendment Date; provided , that with respect to the Repurchase Price due on the Repurchase Date occurring on the Amendment Date, the portion thereof consisting of interest accrued at the Pricing Rate (the "Accrued Interest ") shall be payable (in aggregate with any Repurchase Price owed for any Series Transaction entered into on or after the Amendment Date in accordance with the next paragraph) on the next Repurchase Date in February 2013. For the avoidance of doubt, (a) nothing herein shall affect in any manner (i) the calculation of the Repurchase Price owed under the Original Confirmation with respect to the period of time from the Purchase Date in November 2012 through the Amendment Date or (ii) the Seller's obligation to pay such Repurchase Price (other than the Accrued Interest) to the Buyer on the Amendment Date, (b) notwithstanding the terms of the Master Agreement, this Confirmation or any other document, the delay in payment of the Accrued Interest from the Amendment Date until the Repurchase Date in February 2013 shall not be a default or violation of the Master Agreement or applicable Series Transaction and (c) no interest shall accrue on such due and unpaid Accrued Interest during the period from the Amendment Date through the Repurchase Date in February 2013.   (B) For any Series Transaction entered into on or after the Amendment Date, the CLO Payment Date immediately following the Purchase Date for that Series Transaction.
Pricing Rate: 	    	 For any Series Transaction, the Pricing Rate will be 3.25% (325 basis points) per annum.
Price Differential: 	    	 In addition to the amount defined in paragraph 2(ii) of the Master Agreement, the Price Differential will be increased by any Breakage payable by Seller.
Breakage: 	    	  (a) For any Repurchase Date with respect to which there is no Principal Paydown, zero and   (b) breakage of 125 basis points per annum present valued, determined as follows: for any Repurchase Date with respect to which there is a Principal Paydown (including a Repurchase Date resulting from an Event of Default hereunder) (a "Breakage Date "), an amount, determined by the Buyer in good faith, equal to the present value, discounted at the applicable Swap Rate, of (i) 1.25% per annum multiplied by (ii) 83.333333% of the Principal Paydown multiplied by(iii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days from and including the associated Breakage Date to but excluding the Scheduled Final Repurchase Date and the denominator of which is 360 (the "Discounted Payment ").
Principal Paydown: 	    	  (a) For any Repurchase Date not resulting from an Event of Default hereunder, the Principal Paydown will equal the aggregate principal amount of the CLO Notes to be redeemed pursuant to the CLO Indenture;   (b) for any Repurchase Date resulting from an Event of Default hereunder, the Principal Paydown will be equal to the Class A Maximum Principal Amount (as defined in the CLO Indenture) minus any principal payments previously made on the CLO Notes; and   (c) for any Repurchase Date on which a Purchase Date does not occur due to an Excess Paydown Event, the Principal Paydown will be equal to the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the CLO Notes.
Swap Rate: 	    	    For any Breakage Date and any Discounted Payment, except as provided below, the annual swap rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for a United States Dollar denominated interest rate swap transaction with a maturity equal to the Discounted Tenor which appears on the Reuters Page ISDAFIX1 or any successor page (the "CMS-Screen Page ") as of 11:00 a.m. (New York time) on the Pricing Date, all as determined by Buyer. If there is no quotation for a period
corresponding to the Discounted Tenor, then the Swap Rate for the relevant Breakage Date and Discounted Payment will be determined by linear interpolation.   If at such time the CMS-Screen Page is not available or if no swap rate appears, the relevant rate will be a percentage rate per annum determined on the basis of the mid-market semi-annual interest rate swap rate quotations provided by five leading swap dealers in the New York City interbank market ("Reference Banks ") selected by Buyer at approximately 11:00 a.m. (New York time) on the Pricing Date. For this purpose, the mid-market semi-annual swap rate means the mean of the bid and offered rates for the semi-annual fixed leg, calculated on a 30/360 day count basis, of a fixed-for-floating United States Dollar interest rate swap transaction with a term equal to the Discounted Tenor commencing on that day and in an amount equal to the applicable Principal Paydown with an acknowledged dealer of good credit in the United States Dollar interest rate swap market, where the floating leg, calculated on an Actual/360 day count basis, is equivalent to USD-LIBOR-BBA with a maturity of three months. Buyer will request the principal New York City office of each of the Reference Banks to provide a quotation of its rate. If at least three quotations are provided, the Swap Rate will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations, eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest). If less than three quotations are provided, Buyer will determine the Swap Rate at its sole discretion, acting in good faith and in accordance with standard market practice.
For purposes of the foregoing, for any particular Discounted Payment, the "Discounted Tenor " will mean the period from and including the relevant Breakage Date to but excluding the Scheduled Final Repurchase Date. For purposes of the foregoing, for any given Breakage Date, the "Pricing Date " will be the second Dealing Day prior to the relevant Breakage Date.
Equivalent Securities: 	    	 For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to Purchased Securities (and without limiting the applicability of 2(t)(B) or the second sentence of 2(s), in each case of the Master Agreement), only the CLO Notes (or, where applicable, Distributions in respect thereof) will be considered to be "equivalent to" the CLO Notes.
Additional Terms:
Market Value of the CLO Notes: 	    	 On and after the Amendment Date, the Market Value with respect to the CLO Notes shall be equal to the following: (a) so long as the CLO Collateral Value is greater than or equal to 128.358333% of the
aggregate principal amount of the CLO Notes, then the Initial MV Percentage multiplied by the then-current principal amount of the CLO Notes and (b) otherwise, the Initial MV Percentage multiplied by the then-current principal amount of the CLO Notes minus the difference between (x) 128.358333% of the aggregate principal amount of the CLO Notes and (y) the CLO Collateral Value.   "Initial MV Percentage " means, (i) on the Amendment Date, 100%, and (ii) after the Amendment Date, the percentage of par determined by dividing the market value of the CLO Note (as determined by Buyer) on any Purchase Date or any Ramp-up Date, as applicable, (which, for this purpose, will be a "clean" price excluding accrued interest) by the principal amount of such CLO Note at that date.   "CLO Collateral Value " means, on any date of determination, the sum of: (i) with respect to each Pledged Obligation held by the CLO Issuer that is a Senior Secured Loan or a Second Lien Loan, the aggregate outstanding amount of such Pledged Obligation multiplied by , (1) (x) the average of the indicative bid-side price (expressed as a percentage) for such Pledged Obligation obtained by Buyer from Reuters Loan Pricing Corporation or LoanX, or (y) if only one such indicative bid-side price is available, such indicative bid-side price (expressed as a percentage) or (2) if Buyer determines that neither of such indicative prices is available or that neither of such prices is indicative of the actual current market price of the Pledged Obligation, then the indicative bid-side price (expressed as a percentage) from the loan trading desk of Buyer; (ii) with respect to any other Pledged Obligation (other than Cash) held by the CLO Issuer, the aggregate outstanding amount of such Pledged Obligation multiplied by the market value (expressed as a percentage) of such Pledged Obligation as determined by the Buyer in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner; and (iii) with respect to any Cash held by the CLO Issuer (at such time based on the information most recently made available to the parties by the CLO Trustee), the amount of such Cash.   The market value price determined by Buyer pursuant to clauses (i)(2) and (ii) above is referred to herein as the "JPMCB Determined Price ".   Seller, acting in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, may dispute the JPMCB Determined Price of some or all of the Pledged Obligations for purposes of any Margin Transfer to Buyer by Seller under paragraph 4 of the Master Agreement, if the following conditions are satisfied: (i) the Seller shall make all Margin Transfers required of it in accordance with paragraph 4 of the Master Agreement and (ii) if no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing with respect to Seller, then by no later than 10:00 a.m. (New York time) on the next Dealing Day, Seller
may obtain a firm bid for the full amount of the relevant Pledged Obligation from an Independent Dealer (an "Independent Bid "). The Independent Bid must be maintained by the Independent Dealer and actionable for the Buyer before 12:00 p.m. (New York time) on such Dealing Day. If Seller obtains an Independent Bid and submits to the Buyer evidence of such Independent Bid no later than 10:00 a.m. (New York time) on such Dealing Day, then such Independent Bid (subject to any "Bid Disqualification Condition" as defined below) shall be used to determine the Market Value of such Pledged Obligation for the purposes of paragraph 4 of the Master Agreement (the "Dispute Determined Price ") and the determination of any Margin Securities to be delivered or any Equivalent Margin Securities to be redelivered (in each case, no later than 5:00 p.m. (New York time) on such Dealing Day) in respect of the price established on such Dealing Day shall be based on such Dispute Determined Price.   " Independent Dealers" means Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, Barclays Bank, BNP Paribas, Citibank, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Nomura, Royal Bank of Scotland, UBS, any affiliate of any of the foregoing and any other third party mutually agreed to by Buyer and Seller, but in no event including Seller or any affiliate of Seller.   " Dealing Day" shall mean a day other than a Saturday, Sunday or day on which the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association recommends that there be no trading in US dollar-denominated government securities, mortgage--and asset-backed securities, over-the-counter investment-grade and high-yield corporate bonds, municipal bonds and secondary money market trading in bankers' acceptances, commercial paper and USD and Euro certificates of deposit.   " Bid Disqualification Condition" means that Buyer shall be entitled to disregard as invalid any Independent Bid submitted by any Independent Dealer if, in Buyer's good faith judgment: (i) such Independent Dealer is ineligible to accept assignment or transfer of the relevant Pledged Obligation or portion thereof, as applicable, substantially in accordance with the then-current market practice in the principal market for such Pledged Obligation, as reasonably determined by Buyer; or (ii) such firm bid or such firm offer is not bona fide due to the insolvency of the Independent Dealer or that, as of the relevant date of determination, the Buyer determines in good faith that such Independent Dealer is in default under purchase contracts for assets similar to the Pledged Obligations in an aggregate amount in excess of USD 250,000,000.   The foregoing will not operate in derogation of the obligation to make additional incremental Margin Transfers in respect of any later demands.
The JPMCB Determined Price or Dispute Determined Price for any Pledged Obligation that is under contract to be sold by the CLO Issuer will not exceed the sales price to be received by the CLO Issuer under the relevant sale contract.   It is understood and agreed that the definition of "Market Value" set forth above is not intended to and does not track the definition of "Market Value" set forth in the CLO Indenture.
No Substitution: 	    	 In accordance with paragraph 8(a) of the Master Agreement, substitution is at Buyer's sole discretion.
Additional Event of Default: 	    	  In addition to the Events of Default specified in the Master Agreement, the following shall also constitute an Event of Default (as to which Seller will be the Defaulting Party) for so long as any Series Transaction under this Confirmation is outstanding:   (x) Any CLO Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, (y) the occurrence of "cause" under the Collateral Management Agreement (as defined in the CLO Indenture), or (z) a breach of any of the covenants contained in Section 9(j) of Seller's LLC Agreement shall have occurred and be continuing and, in either case of (x), (y) or (z), the non-Defaulting Party serves a notice on the Defaulting Party. For purposes of the foregoing, the Seller will be the Defaulting Party and the Buyer will be the non-Defaulting Party.
CLO Event of Default: 	    	 An "Event of Default" as defined in the CLO Indenture.
Additional Representation of Cobbs Creek: 	    	  As of the initial Purchase Date, Cobbs Creek represents that the Final Repurchase Date is a date certain calculated as follows:   (i) if the expected weighted average final amortisation of the Purchased Securities (the "Expected Amortisation Date ") will occur 5 years or more after the initial Purchase Date for the Purchased Securities, the earlier of the date on which 80% of the number of days occurring between the initial Purchase Date for such Purchased Securities and the Expected Amortisation Date have lapsed or the date on which 20% or less of the initial principal amount of the Purchased Securities is outstanding, and   (ii) if the Expected Amortisation Date will occur more than one but less than five years after the initial Purchase Date for the Purchased Securities, the earlier of the date occurring one year prior to the Expected Amortisation Date or the date on which 20% or less of the initial principal amount of the Purchased Securities is outstanding.
Application of Payments: 	    	  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Master Agreement, payments under the CLO Notes (whether Income or Distributions) received on a Repurchase Date will be applied in the following order:   first , to payment of the Repurchase Price;   second , if the Adjusted Net Worth of the Collateral is less than the Collateral Minimum, to deposit into the Custodial Account an amount equal to the lesser of (i) (1) the Collateral Minimum minus (2) the Adjusted Net Worth of the Collateral, and (ii) the amount of the payment received;   third , to any unpaid Margin Transfer amounts owing from Seller to Buyer which would exist after giving effect to repayment of the maturing repurchase transaction and entry into the new repurchase transaction; and   fourth , with respect any remaining amounts (x) prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default, distributed in accordance with the terms of Section 6(o) of Annex I of the Master Agreement or (y) after the occurrence of an Event of Default, Buyer will be entitled to retain any Income or Distribution as additional Margin.
Acknowledgement by Cobbs Creek: 	    	  For the avoidance of doubt, and not to be construed in derogation of the conveyance of the Purchased Securities hereunder, Seller acknowledges that all of Seller's interest in the Purchased Securities shall pass to Buyer on each Purchase Date and, unless otherwise agreed by Buyer and Seller, (i) nothing in this Confirmation shall preclude Buyer from engaging in repurchase transactions with the Purchased Securities or otherwise selling, transferring, pledging or hypothecating the Purchased Securities, (ii) at all times prior to the Final Purchase Date, Buyer shall have the sole right to vote and exercise all other rights and privileges of a holder of the CLO Notes, including, but not limited to, the rights to accelerate and order disposition of assets and the rights set forth in Sections 7.20 and 7.21 of the CLO Indenture, in each case in accordance with the relevant provisions of the CLO Indenture; provided that, so long as no Event of Default or potential Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Seller, and not the Buyer, shall be entitled to exercise the rights set forth in Section 7.20 of the CLO Indenture, and (iii) Buyer will be entitled to receive all payments under the Purchased Securities subject to paragraph 5 of the Master Agreement and the Application of Payments.   Seller further acknowledges and agrees that (x) neither JPMCB nor any of its affiliates have acted in any placement agent, underwriter or arranger capacity with respect to the Purchased Securities, and (y)
following the earlier of (1) the end of the Initial Investment Period (as defined in the CLO Indenture) and (2) the date on which the CLO Notes have been increased to their respective Maximum Principal Amount (as defined in the CLO Indenture), JPMCB may convert the Purchased Securities from certificated to book-entry securities and, in connection with such conversion, JPMCB may, itself or through any of its affiliates, coordinate with Depository Trust Company ("DTC") (including by completing any required DTC documentation) to facilitate such conversion; it being agreed, for the avoidance of doubt, that JPMCB's or its affiliate's role in the conversion of the Purchased Securities is merely for administrative convenience and, notwithstanding any provisions in the required DTC documentation, shall in no event imply that JPMCB or its affiliate have performed or are performing any role as placement agent, underwriter or arranger with respect to the Purchased Securities.
Tax Treatment 	    	 The parties agree that each Series Transaction shall be treated as a loan by the Buyer to FS Investment Corporation II for federal, state and local income and franchise tax purposes.
