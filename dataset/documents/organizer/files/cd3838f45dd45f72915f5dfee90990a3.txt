of the Fixed Rate Swap from S&P;, the greater of:
A.      zero;
B.      CR; and
C.      the net amount (if any) as determined by the Manager that is expected to be due by Party A to Party B in respect of the Fixed Rate Swap on the immediately following Monthly Distribution Date (calculated on the basis that there will be no prepayments made by the Mortgagors under the Mortgage Loans then being charged interest at a fixed rate and no conversion of the interest rate payable under any Mortgage Loan from a fixed rate to a variable rate or from a variable rate to a fixed rate during the relevant Monthly Swap Collection Period).

(c)     (MARK TO MARKET VALUE): Party A must calculate the mark-to-market value of the Fixed Rate Swaps by obtaining 2 bids from counterparties with the Prescribed Ratings willing to provide the Fixed Rate Swaps in the absence of Party A. The mark-to-market value may be a positive or a negative amount. A bid has a negative value if the payment to be made is from the counterparty to Party A and has a positive value if the payment to be made is from Party A to the counterparty. The mark-to-market value is the higher of the bids (on the basis that any bid of a positive value is higher than any bid of a negative value).
(d)     (RECALCULATION): Party A must recalculate the Fixed Rate Prepayment
Amount (including the CR and the mark-to-market value) on a weekly basis. If:
(i)     the recalculated Fixed Rate Prepayment Amount is greater than the immediately preceding Fixed Rate Prepayment Amount, Party A must make an additional prepayment in accordance with Section 17(a)(iii) within 3 Business Days of such recalculation so that the Fixed Rate Prepayment Balance equals the recalculated Fixed Rate Prepayment Amount; or
(ii)    the recalculated Fixed Rate Prepayment Amount is less than the immediately preceding Fixed Rate Prepayment Amount, Party B must upon the direction of the Manager withdraw an amount from the Eligible Account referred to in Section 17(a)(iii) and pay it to Party A within 3 Business Days of receiving notice of such recalculation so that the remaining Fixed Rate Prepayment Balance after such withdrawal equals the recalculated Fixed Rate Prepayment Amount.

(f)     (UTILISATION): If the Fixed Rate Prepayment Balance is applied towards an amount payable by Party A in accordance with Section 2(f)(i) Party A must within 3 Business Days make an additional prepayment in accordance with Section 17(a)(iii) equal to the amount so applied.
(g)     (REPAYMENT): If Party A regains the Prescribed Rating in respect of the Fixed Rate Swaps Party B must, upon the direction of the Manager, repay to Party A the then Fixed Rate Prepayment Balance.
(h)     (VARIATION OF MANNER OF SATISFACTION): Notwithstanding that Party A has elected to satisfy its obligations pursuant to this Section 17 in a particular manner, it may subsequently and from time to time vary the manner in which it satisfies its obligations pursuant to this Section 17 (but will not be entitled to any additional grace period in relation to such a variation).

Interest will be payable by Party B on any prepayment by Party A under this Section 18 in accordance with clause 8.8 of the Series Supplement.
19.     SECURITIES REPAID
On the date that the Invested Amount in respect of the Securities has been reduced to zero, or the Securities are redeemed in full or are deemed to have been redeemed in full under the Series Supplement, whichever is the earlier, Party A's obligations under Sections 17 and 18 will cease and Party B must pay to Party A on that date the Outstanding Interest Rate Swap Prepayment Amount and interest on such payment.".

(a)     Neither the interests nor the obligations of either party in or under this Agreement (including any Transaction) are capable of being assigned or transferred (whether at law, in equity or otherwise), charged or the subject of any trust (other than the Series Trust or the trusts created pursuant to any Credit Support Document in relation to Party B) or other fiduciary obligation. Any action by a party which purports to do any of these things is void.
(b)     Nothing in this Section 7:

(iii)   restricts a transfer by a party of all or any part of its interest in any amount payable to it from a Defaulting Party under Section 6(e); or
(iv)    restricts Party B from granting security over a Transaction or this Agreement pursuant to any Credit Support Document in relation to Party B,
provided that the Rating Agencies have confirmed that such transfer, variation or assignment by way of security (as the case may be) will not result in a reduction, qualification or withdrawal of the credit ratings then assigned by them to the Securities.
(c)     Each party acknowledges that the other party enters into this Agreement and each Transaction on the basis that this Section 7 must be strictly observed and is essential to the terms of this Agreement (including each Transaction)."
(16)    KNOWLEDGE OR AWARENESS
Subject to Section 12(a), each party will only be considered to have knowledge or awareness of, or notice of, a thing or grounds to believe anything by virtue of the officers of that party or any Related Body Corporate of that party which have the day to day responsibility for the administration or management of that party's (or a Related Body Corporate of that party's) obligations in relation to the Series Trust or the Transactions entered into under this Agreement having actual knowledge, actual awareness or actual notice of that thing, or grounds or reason to believe that thing (and similar references will be interpreted in this way).
(17)    INTEREST RATE BASIS CAP
The parties agree that any Interest Rate Basis Cap entered into between them pursuant to clause 16.6(k) of the Series Supplement will be entered into as a transaction governed by the terms of this Agreement.
(18)    AMENDMENT TO THIS AGREEMENT
