On and
after the date hereof, each reference in the First Lien ISDA Master Agreement to "this Agreement", "hereunder", "hereof" or words of like import referring to the First Lien ISDA Master Agreement, and each reference in each of the other Transaction Documents to "the Intermediation Agreement", "the First Lien ISDA Master Agreement", "thereunder", "thereof" or words of like import referring to the First Lien ISDA Master Agreement, shall mean and be a reference to the First Lien ISDA Master Agreement, as amended by this Amendment.

However, this Amendment shall bind no party until Party B and Party A have executed and delivered a counterpart. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Amendment by telecopier or other electronic transmission (i.e., a "pdf" or "tif" document) shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Amendment.
