MASTER AGREEMENT
dated as of September  22, 2009
SEMPRA ENERGY TRADING LLC 	    	  MXENERGY INC.
( "Party A") 	    	  ( "Party B")
have entered and/or anticipate entering into one or more transactions (each a "Transaction") that are or will be governed by this Master Agreement, which includes the schedule (the "Schedule"), and the documents and other confirming evidence (each a "Confirmation") exchanged between the parties confirming those Transactions.
Accordingly, the parties agree as follows:--
# 1. Interpretation
#
## (a) Definitions. The terms defined in Section 14 and in the Schedule will have the meanings therein specified for the purpose of this Master Agreement.
##
## (b) Inconsistency. In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of the Schedule and the other provisions of this Master Agreement, the Schedule will prevail. In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of any Confirmation and this Master Agreement (including the Schedule), such Confirmation will prevail for the purpose of the relevant Transaction.
##
## (c) Single Agreement. All Transactions are entered into in reliance on the fact that this Master Agreement and all Confirmations form a single agreement between the parties (collectively referred to as this "Agreement"), and the parties would not otherwise enter into any Transactions.
##
# 2. Obligations
#
## (a) General Conditions.
##
### (i) Each party will make each payment or delivery specified in each Confirmation to be made by it, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement.
###
### (ii) Payments under this Agreement will be made on the due date for value on that date in the place of the account specified in the relevant Confirmation or otherwise
### pursuant to this Agreement, in freely transferable funds and in the manner customary for payments in the required currency. Where settlement is by delivery (that is, other than by payment), such delivery will be made for receipt on the due date in the manner customary for the relevant obligation unless otherwise specified in the relevant Confirmation or elsewhere in this Agreement.
###
### (iii) Each obligation of each party under Section 2(a)(i) is subject to
(1) the condition precedent that no Event of Default or Potential Event of Default with respect to the other party has occurred and is continuing, (2) the condition precedent that no Early Termination Date in respect of the relevant Transaction has occurred or been effectively designated and (3) each other applicable condition precedent specified in this Agreement.
###
## (b) Change of Account. Either party may change its account for receiving a payment or delivery by giving notice to the other party at least five Local Business Days prior to the scheduled date for the payment or delivery to which such change applies unless such other party gives timely notice of a reasonable objection to such change.
##
## (c) Netting. If on any date amounts would otherwise be payable:--
##
### (i) in the same currency; and
###
### (ii) in respect of the same Transaction,
###
by each party to the other, then, on such date, each party's obligation to make payment of any such amount will be automatically satisfied and discharged and, if the aggregate amount that would otherwise have been payable by one party exceeds the aggregate amount that would otherwise have been payable by the other party, replaced by an obligation upon the party by whom the larger aggregate amount would have been payable to pay to the other party the excess of the larger aggregate amount over the smaller aggregate amount.
The parties may elect in respect of two or more Transactions that a net amount will be determined in respect of all amounts payable on the same date in the same currency in respect of such Transactions, regardless of whether such amounts are payable in respect of the same Transaction. The election may be made in the Schedule or a Confirmation by specifying that subparagraph (ii) above will not apply to the Transactions identified as being subject to the election, together with the starting date (in which case subparagraph (ii) above will not, or will cease to, apply to such Transactions from such date).
This election may be made separately for different groups of Transactions and will apply separately to each pairing of Offices through which the parties make and receive payments or deliveries.
## (d) Deduction or Withholding for Tax.
##
### (i) Gross-Up. All payments under this Agreement will be made without any deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax unless such deduction or withholding is required by any applicable law, as modified by the practice of any relevant governmental revenue authority, then in effect. If a party is so required to deduct or withhold, then that party ("X") will:--
#### (1) promptly notify the other party ("Y") of such requirement;
####
#### (2) pay to the relevant authorities the full amount required to be deducted or withheld (including the full amount required to be deducted or withheld from any additional amount paid by X to Y under this Section 2(d)) promptly upon the earlier of determining that such deduction or withholding is required or receiving notice that such amount has been assessed against Y;
####
#### (3) promptly forward to Y an official receipt (or a certified copy), or other documentation reasonably acceptable to Y, evidencing such payment to such authorities; and
####
#### (4) if such Tax is an Indemnifiable Tax, pay to Y, in addition to the payment to which Y is otherwise entitled under this Agreement, such additional amount as is necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by Y (free and clear of Indemnifiable Taxes, whether assessed against X or Y) will equal the full amount Y would have received had no such deduction or withholding been required. However, X will not be required to pay any additional amount to Y to the extent that it would not be required to be paid but for:--
####
##### (A) the failure by Y to comply with or perform any agreement contained in Section 4(a)(i), 4(a)(iii) or 4(d); or
#####
##### (B) the failure of a representation made by Y pursuant to Section 3(f) to be accurate and true unless such failure would not have occurred but for
(I) any action taken by a taxing authority, or brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, on or after the date on which a Transaction is entered into (regardless of whether such action is taken or brought with respect to a party to this Agreement) or (II) a Change in Tax Law.
#####
### (ii) Liability. If: --
###
#### (1) X is required by any applicable law, as modified by the practice of any relevant governmental revenue authority, to make any deduction or withholding in respect of which X would not be required to pay an additional amount to Y under Section 2(d)(i)(4);
####
#### (2) X does not so deduct or withhold; and (3) a liability resulting from such Tax is assessed directly against X, then, except to the extent Y has satisfied or then satisfies the liability resulting from such Tax, Y will promptly pay to X the amount of such liability (including any related liability for interest, but including any related liability for penalties only if Y has failed to comply with or perform any agreement contained in Section 4(a)(i), 4(a)(iii) or 4(d)).
##
## (e) Default Interest; Other Amounts. Prior to the occurrence or effective designation of an Early Termination Date in respect of the relevant Transaction, a party that defaults in the performance of any payment obligation will, to the extent permitted by law and subject to Section 6(c), be required to pay interest (before as well as after judgment) on the overdue amount
## to the other party on demand in the same currency as such overdue amount, for the period from (and including) the original due date for payment to (but excluding) the date of actual payment, at the Default Rate. Such interest will be calculated on the basis of daily compounding and the actual number of days elapsed. If, prior to the occurrence or effective designation of an Early Termination Date in respect of the relevant Transaction, a party defaults in the performance of any obligation required to be settled by delivery, it will compensate the other party on demand if and to the extent provided for in the relevant Confirmation or elsewhere in this Agreement.
##
# 3. Representations
#
Each party represents to the other party (which representations will be deemed to be repeated by each party on each date on which a Transaction is entered into and, in the case of the representations in Section 3(f), at all times until the termination of this Agreement) that:--
## (a) Basic Representations.

##
## (b) Absence of Certain Events. No Event of Default or Potential Event of Default or, to its knowledge, Termination Event with respect to it has occurred and is continuing and no such event or circumstance would occur as a result of its entering into or performing its obligations under this Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which it is a party.
## (c) Absence of Litigation.

##
# 5. Events of Default and Termination Events
#
## (a) Events of Default. The occurrence at any time with respect to a party or, if applicable, any Credit Support Provider of such party or any Specified Entity of such party of any of the following events constitutes an event of default (an "Event of Default") with respect to such party:--
##
### (i) Failure to Pay or Deliver. Failure by the party to make, when due, any payment under this Agreement or delivery under Section 2(a)(i) or 2(e) required to be made by it if such failure is not remedied on or before the third Local Business Day after notice of such failure is given to the party;
###
### (ii) Breach of Agreement. Failure by the party to comply with or perform any agreement or obligation (other than an obligation to make any payment under this Agreement or delivery under Section 2(a)(i) or 2(e) or to give notice of a Termination Event or any agreement or obligation under Section 4(a)(i), 4(a)(iii) or 4(d)) to be complied with or performed by the party in accordance with this Agreement if such failure is not remedied on or before the thirtieth day after notice of such failure is given to the party;
###
### (iii) Credit Support Default.
####
#### (1) Failure by the party or any Credit Support Provider of such party to comply with or perform any agreement or obligation to be complied with or performed by it in accordance with any Credit Support Document if such failure is continuing after any applicable grace period has elapsed;
#### (2) the expiration or termination of such Credit Support Document or the failing or ceasing of such Credit Support Document to be in full force and effect for the purpose of this Agreement (in either case other than in accordance with its terms) prior to the satisfaction of all obligations of such party under each Transaction to which such Credit Support Document relates without the written consent of the other party; or
####
#### (3) the party or such Credit Support Provider disaffirms, disclaims, repudiates or rejects, in whole or in part, or challenges the validity of, such Credit Support Document;
####
### (iv) Misrepresentation. A representation (other than a representation under Section 3(e) or (f)) made or repeated or deemed to have been made or repeated by the party or any Credit Support Provider of such party in this Agreement or any Credit Support Document proves to have been incorrect or misleading in any material respect when made or repeated or deemed to have been made or repeated;
###
### (v) Default under Specified Transaction. The party, any Credit Support Provider of such party or any applicable Specified Entity of such party (1) defaults under a Specified Transaction and, after giving effect to any applicable notice requirement or grace period, there occurs a liquidation of, an acceleration of obligations under, or an early termination of, that Specified Transaction, (2) defaults, after giving effect to any applicable notice requirement or grace period, in making any payment or delivery due on the last payment, delivery or exchange date of, or any payment on early termination of, a Specified Transaction (or such default continues for at least three Local Business Days if there is no applicable notice requirement or grace period) or (3) disaffirms, disclaims, repudiates or rejects, in whole or in part, a Specified Transaction (or such action is taken by any person or entity appointed or empowered to operate it or act on its behalf);
###
### (vi) Cross Default. If "Cross Default" is specified in the Schedule as applying to the party, the occurrence or existence of (1) a default, event of default or other similar condition or event (however described) in respect of such party, any Credit Support Provider of such party or any applicable Specified Entity of such party under one or more agreements or instruments relating to Specified Indebtedness of any of them (individually or collectively) in an aggregate amount of not less than the applicable Threshold Amount (as specified in the Schedule) which has resulted in such Specified Indebtedness becoming, or becoming capable at such time of being declared, due and payable under such agreements or instruments, before it would otherwise have been due and payable or (2) a default by such party, such Credit Support Provider or such Specified Entity (individually or collectively) in making one or more payments on the due date thereof in an aggregate amount of not less than the applicable Threshold Amount under such agreements or instruments (after giving effect to any applicable notice requirement or grace period);
###
### (vii) Bankruptcy. The party, any Credit Support Provider of such party or any applicable Specified Entity of such party: --
#### (1) is dissolved (other than pursuant to a consolidation, amalgamation or merger); (2) becomes insolvent or is unable to pay its debts or fails or admits in writing its inability generally to pay its debts as they become due;
(3) makes a general assignment, arrangement or composition with or for the benefit of its creditors; (4) institutes or has instituted against it a proceeding seeking a judgment of insolvency or bankruptcy or any other relief under any bankruptcy or insolvency law or other similar law affecting creditors' rights, or a petition is presented for its winding-up or liquidation, and, in the case of any such proceeding or petition instituted or presented against it, such proceeding or petition (A) results in a judgment of insolvency or bankruptcy or the entry of an order for relief or the making of an order for its winding-up or liquidation or (B) is not dismissed, discharged, stayed or restrained in each case within 30 days of the institution or presentation thereof; (5) has a resolution passed for its winding-up, official management or liquidation (other than pursuant to a consolidation, amalgamation or merger); (6) seeks or becomes subject to the appointment of an administrator, provisional liquidator, conservator, receiver, trustee, custodian or other similar official for it or for all or substantially all its assets; (7) has a secured party take possession of all or substantially all its assets or has a distress, execution, attachment, sequestration or other legal process levied, enforced or sued on or against all or substantially all its assets and such secured party maintains possession, or any such process is not dismissed, discharged, stayed or restrained, in each case within 30 days thereafter; (8) causes or is subject to any event with respect to it which, under the applicable laws of any jurisdiction, has an analogous effect to any of the events specified in clauses (1) to (7) (inclusive); or (9) takes any action in furtherance of, or indicating its consent to, approval of, or acquiescence in, any of the foregoing acts; or
####
### (viii) Merger Without Assumption. The party or any Credit Support Provider of such party consolidates or amalgamates with, or merges with or into, or transfers all or substantially all its assets to, another entity and, at the time of such consolidation, amalgamation, merger or transfer: --
###
#### (1) the resulting, surviving or transferee entity fails to assume all the obligations of such party or such Credit Support Provider under this Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which it or its predecessor was a party by operation of law or pursuant to an agreement reasonably satisfactory to the other party to this Agreement; or
####
#### (2) the benefits of any Credit Support Document fail to extend (without the consent of the other party) to the performance by such resulting, surviving or transferee entity of its obligations under this Agreement.
##
## (b) Termination Events. The occurrence at any time with respect to a party or, if applicable, any Credit Support Provider of such party or any Specified Entity of such party of any event specified below constitutes an Illegality if the event is specified in (i) below, a Tax Event if the event is specified in (ii) below or a Tax Event Upon Merger if the event is specified in (iii) below, and, if specified to be applicable, a Credit Event (i) Illegality. Due to the adoption of, or
## any change in, any applicable law after the date on which a Transaction is entered into, or due to the promulgation of, or any change in, the interpretation by any court, tribunal or regulatory authority with competent jurisdiction of any applicable law after such date, it becomes unlawful (other than as a result of a breach by the party of Section 4(b)) for such party (which will be the Affected Party): --
##
#### (1) to perform any absolute or contingent obligation to make a payment or delivery or to receive a payment or delivery in respect of such Transaction or to comply with any other material provision of this Agreement relating to such Transaction; or
####
#### (2) to perform, or for any Credit Support Provider of such party to perform, any contingent or other obligation which the party (or such Credit Support Provider) has under any Credit Support Document relating to such Transaction;
####
### (ii) Tax Event. Due to (x) any action taken by a taxing authority, or brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, on or after the date on which a Transaction is entered into (regardless of whether such action is taken or brought with respect to a party to this Agreement) or (y) a Change in Tax Law, the party (which will be the Affected Party) will, or there is a substantial likelihood that it will, on the next succeeding Scheduled Payment Date (1) be required to pay to the other party an additional amount in respect of an Indemnifiable Tax under Section 2(d)(i)(4) (except in respect of interest under Section 2(e), 6(d)(ii) or 6(e)) or (2) receive a payment from which an amount is required to be deducted or withheld for or on account of a Tax (except in respect of interest under Section 2(e), 6(d)(ii) or 6(e)) and no additional amount is required to be paid in respect of such Tax under Section 2(d)(i)(4) (other than by reason of Section 2(d)(i)(4)(A) or (B));
###
### (iii) Tax Event Upon Merger. The party (the "Burdened Party") on the next succeeding Scheduled Payment Date will either (1) be required to pay an additional amount in respect of an Indemnifiable Tax under Section 2(d)(i)(4) (except in respect of interest under Section 2(e), 6(d)(ii) or 6(e)) or (2) receive a payment from which an amount has been deducted or withheld for or on account of any Indemnifiable Tax in respect of which the other party is not required to pay an additional amount (other than by reason of Section 2(d)(i)(4)(A) or (B)), in either case as a result of a party consolidating or amalgamating with, or merging with or into, or transferring all or substantially all its assets to, another entity (which will be the Affected Party) where such action does not constitute an event described in Section 5(a)(viii);
###
### (iv) Credit Event Upon Merger. If "Credit Event Upon Merger" is specified in the Schedule as applying to the party, such party ("X"), any Credit Support Provider of X or any applicable Specified Entity of X consolidates or amalgamates with, or merges with or into, or transfers all or substantially all its assets to, another entity and such action does not constitute an event described in Section 5(a)(viii) but the creditworthiness of the resulting, surviving or transferee entity is materially weaker than that of X, such Credit Support Provider or such Specified Entity, as the case may be, immediately prior to such action (and, in such event, X or its successor or transferee, as appropriate, will be the Affected Party); or
### (v) Additional Termination Event. If any "Additional Termination Event" is specified in the Schedule or any Confirmation as applying, the occurrence of such event (and, in such event, the Affected Party or Affected Parties shall be as specified for such Additional Termination Event in the Schedule or such Confirmation).
###
## (c) Event of Default and Illegality. If an event or circumstance which would otherwise constitute or give rise to an Event of Default also constitutes an Illegality, it will be treated as an Illegality and will not constitute an Event of Default.
##
# 6. Early Termination
#
## (a) Right to Terminate Following Event of Default. If at any time an Event of Default with respect to a party (the "Defaulting Party") has occurred and is then continuing, the other party (the "Non-defaulting Party") may, by not more than 20 days notice to the Defaulting Party specifying the relevant Event of Default, designate a day not earlier than the day such notice is effective as an Early Termination Date in respect of all outstanding Transactions. If, however, "Automatic Early Termination" is specified in the Schedule as applying to a party, then an Early Termination Date in respect of all outstanding Transactions will occur immediately upon the occurrence with respect to such party of an Event of Default specified in Section 5(a)(vii)(1), (3), (5), (6) or, to the extent analogous thereto, (8), and as of the time immediately preceding the institution of the relevant proceeding or the presentation of the relevant petition upon the occurrence with respect to such party of an Event of Default specified in Section 5(a)(vii)(4) or, to the extent analogous thereto, (8).
##
## (b) Right to Terminate Following Termination Event.
##
### (i) Notice. If a Termination Event occurs, an Affected Party will, promptly upon becoming aware of it, notify the other party, specifying the nature of that Termination Event and each Affected Transaction and will also give such other information about that Termination Event as the other party may reasonably require.
###
### (ii) Transfer to Avoid Termination Event. If either an Illegality under Section 5(b)(i)(1) or a Tax Event occurs and there is only one Affected Party, or if a Tax Event Upon Merger occurs and the Burdened Party is the Affected Party, the Affected Party will, as a condition to its right to designate an Early Termination Date under Section 6(b)(iv), use all reasonable efforts (which will not require such party to incur a loss, excluding immaterial, incidental expenses) to transfer within 20 days after it gives notice under Section 6(b)(i) all its rights and obligations under this Agreement in respect of the Affected Transactions to another of its Offices or Affiliates so that such Termination Event ceases to exist.
If the Affected Party is not able to make such a transfer it will give notice to the other party to that effect within such 20 day period, whereupon the other party may effect such a transfer within 30 days after the notice is given under Section 6(b)(i).
Any such transfer by a party under this Section 6(b)(ii) will be subject to and conditional upon the prior written consent of the other party, which consent will not be withheld if
such other party's policies in effect at such time would permit it to enter into transactions with the transferee on the terms proposed.
### (iii) Two Affected Parties. If an Illegality under Section 5(b)(i)(1) or a Tax Event occurs and there are two Affected Parties, each party will use all reasonable efforts to reach agreement within 30 days after notice thereof is given under Section 6(b)(i) on action to avoid that Termination Event.
###
### (iv) Right to Terminate. If: --
###
#### (1) a transfer under Section 6(b)(ii) or an agreement under Section 6(b)(iii), as the case may be, has not been effected with respect to all Affected Transactions within 30 days after an Affected Party gives notice under Section 6(b)(i); or
####
#### (2) an Illegality under Section 5(b)(i)(2), a Credit Event Upon Merger or an Additional Termination Event occurs, or a Tax Event Upon Merger occurs and the Burdened Party is not the Affected Party,
####
either party in the case of an Illegality, the Burdened Party in the case of a Tax Event Upon Merger, any Affected Party in the case of a Tax Event or an Additional Termination Event if there is more than one Affected Party, or the party which is not the Affected Party in the case of a Credit Event Upon Merger or an Additional Termination Event if there is only one Affected Party may, by not more than 20 days notice to the other party and provided that the relevant Termination Event is then continuing, designate a day not earlier than the day such notice is effective as an Early Termination Date in respect of all Affected Transactions.
## (c) Effect of Designation.
##
### (i) If notice designating an Early Termination Date is given under Section 6(a) or (b), the Early Termination Date will occur on the date so designated, whether or not the relevant Event of Default or Termination Event is then continuing.
###
### (ii) Upon the occurrence or effective designation of an Early Termination Date, no further payments or deliveries under Section 2(a)(i) or 2(e) in respect of the Terminated Transactions will be required to be made, but without prejudice to the other provisions of this Agreement. The amount, if any, payable in respect of an Early Termination Date shall be determined pursuant to Section 6(e).
###
## (d) Calculations.
##
### (i) Statement. On or as soon as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of an Early Termination Date, each party will make the calculations on its part, if any, contemplated by Section 6(e) and will provide to the other party a statement (1) showing, in reasonable detail, such calculations (including all relevant quotations and specifying any amount payable under Section 6(e)) and (2) giving details of the relevant account to which any amount payable to it is to be paid. In the absence of written confirmation from the source of a quotation obtained in determining a Market Quotation, the records of the
### party obtaining such quotation will be conclusive evidence of the existence and accuracy of such quotation.
###
### (ii) Payment Date. An amount calculated as being due in respect of any Early Termination Date under Section 6(e) will be payable on the day that notice of the amount payable is effective (in the case of an Early Termination Date which is designated or occurs as a result of an Event of Default) and on the day which is two Local Business Days after the day on which notice of the amount payable is effective (in the case of an Early Termination Date which is designated as a result of a Termination Event). Such amount will be paid together with (to the extent permitted under applicable law) interest thereon (before as well as after judgment) in the Termination Currency, from (and including) the relevant Early Termination Date to (but excluding) the date such amount is paid, at the Applicable Rate. Such interest will be calculated on the basis of daily compounding and the actual number of days elapsed.
###
## (e) Payments on Early Termination. If an Early Termination Date occurs, the following provisions shall apply based on the parties' election in the Schedule of a payment measure, either "Market Quotation" or "Loss", and a payment method, either the "First Method" or the "Second Method". If the parties fail to designate a payment measure or payment method in the Schedule, it will be deemed that "Market Quotation" or the "Second Method", as the case may be, shall apply. The amount, if any, payable in respect of an Early Termination Date and determined pursuant to this Section will be subject to any Set-off.
##
### (i) Events of Default. If the Early Termination Date results from an Event of Default:--
###
#### (1) First Method and Market Quotation. If the First Method and Market Quotation apply, the Defaulting Party will pay to the Non-defaulting Party the excess, if a positive number, of (A) the sum of the Settlement Amount (determined by the Non-defaulting Party) in respect of the Terminated Transactions and the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to the Non-defaulting Party over (B) the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to the Defaulting Party.
####
#### (2) First Method and Loss. If the First Method and Loss apply, the Defaulting Party will pay to the Non-defaulting Party, if a positive number, the Non-defaulting Party's Loss in respect of this Agreement.
####
#### (3) Second Method and Market Quotation. If the Second Method and Market Quotation apply, an amount will be payable equal to (A) the sum of the Settlement Amount (determined by the Non-defaulting Party) in respect of the Terminated Transactions and the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to the Non-defaulting Party less (B) the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to the Defaulting Party. If that amount is a positive number, the Defaulting Party will pay it to the Non-defaulting Party; if it is a negative number, the Non-defaulting Party will pay the absolute value of that amount to the Defaulting Party.
#### (4) Second Method and Loss. If the Second Method and Loss apply, an amount will be payable equal to the Non-defaulting Party's Loss in respect of this Agreement. If that amount is a positive number, the Defaulting Party will pay it to the Non-defaulting Party; if it is a negative number, the Non- defaulting Party will pay the absolute value of that amount to the Defaulting Party.
####
### (ii) Termination Events. If the Early Termination Date results from a Termination Event:--
###
#### (1) One Affected Party. If there is one Affected Party, the amount payable will be determined in accordance with Section 6(e)(i)(3), if Market Quotation applies, or Section 6(e)(i)(4), if Loss applies, except that, in either case, references to the Defaulting Party and to the Non-defaulting Party will be deemed to be references to the Affected Party and the party which is not the Affected Party, respectively, and, if Loss applies and fewer than all the Transactions are being terminated, Loss shall be calculated in respect of all Terminated Transactions.
####
#### (2) Two Affected Parties. If there are two Affected Parties:--
####
##### (A) if Market Quotation applies, each party will determine a Settlement Amount in respect of the Terminated Transactions, and an amount will be payable equal to (I) the sum of (a) one-half of the difference between the Settlement Amount of the party with the higher Settlement Amount ("X") and the Settlement Amount of the party with the lower Settlement Amount ("Y") and (b) the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to X less (II) the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to Y; and
#####
##### (B) if Loss applies, each party will determine its Loss in respect of this Agreement (or, if fewer than all the Transactions are being terminated, in respect of all Terminated Transactions) and an amount will be payable equal to one-half of the difference between the Loss of the party with the higher Loss ("X") and the Loss of the party with the lower Loss ("Y").
#####
If the amount payable is a positive number, Y will pay it to X; if it is a negative number, X will pay the absolute value of that amount to Y.
### (iii) Adjustment for Bankruptcy. In circumstances where an Early Termination Date occurs because "Automatic Early Termination" applies in respect of a party, the amount determined under this Section 6(e) will be subject to such adjustments as are appropriate and permitted by law to reflect any payments or deliveries made by one party to the other under this Agreement (and retained by such other party) during the period from the relevant Early Termination Date to the date for payment determined under Section 6(d)(ii).
###
### (iv) Pre-Estimate. The parties agree that if Market Quotation applies an amount recoverable under this Section 6(e) is a reasonable pre- estimate of loss and not a penalty. Such amount is payable for the loss of bargain and the loss of protection against future
### risks and except as otherwise provided in this Agreement neither party will be entitled to recover any additional damages as a consequence of such losses.
###
# 7. Transfer
#
Subject to Section 6(b)(ii), neither this Agreement nor any interest or obligation in or under this Agreement may be transferred (whether by way of security or otherwise) by either party without the prior written consent of the other party, except that: --
## (a) a party may make such a transfer of this Agreement pursuant to a consolidation or amalgamation with, or merger with or into, or transfer of all or substantially all its assets to, another entity (but without prejudice to any other right or remedy under this Agreement); and
##
## (b) a party may make such a transfer of all or any part of its interest in any amount payable to it from a Defaulting Party under Section 6(e).
##
Any purported transfer that is not in compliance with this Section will be void.
# 8. Contractual Currency
#
## (a) Payment in the Contractual Currency. Each payment under this Agreement will be made in the relevant currency specified in this Agreement for that payment (the "Contractual Currency"). To the extent permitted by applicable law, any obligation to make payments under this Agreement in the Contractual Currency will not be discharged or satisfied by any tender in any currency other than the Contractual Currency, except to the extent such tender results in the actual receipt by the party to which payment is owed, acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith in converting the currency so tendered into the Contractual Currency, of the full amount in the Contractual Currency of all amounts payable in respect of this Agreement. If for any reason the amount in the Contractual Currency so received falls short of the amount in the Contractual Currency payable in respect of this Agreement, the party required to make the payment will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, immediately pay such additional amount in the Contractual Currency as may be necessary to compensate for the shortfall. If for any reason the amount in the Contractual Currency so received exceeds the amount in the Contractual Currency payable in respect of this Agreement, the party receiving the payment will refund promptly the amount of such excess.
##
## (b) Judgments. To the extent permitted by applicable law, if any judgment or order expressed in a currency other than the Contractual Currency is rendered (i) for the payment of any amount owing in respect of this Agreement, (ii) for the payment of any amount relating to any early termination in respect of this Agreement or (iii) in respect of a judgment or order of another court for the payment of any amount described in (i) or (ii) above, the party seeking recovery, after recovery in full of the aggregate amount to which such party is entitled pursuant to the judgment or order, will be entitled to receive immediately from the other party the amount of any shortfall of the Contractual Currency received by such party as a consequence of sums paid in such other currency and will refund promptly to the other party any excess of the Contractual Currency received by such party as a consequence of sums paid in such other currency if such shortfall or such excess arises or results from any variation between the rate of exchange at which the Contractual Currency is converted into the currency of the judgment or
## order for the purposes of such judgment or order and the rate of exchange at which such party is able, acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith in converting the currency received into the Contractual Currency, to purchase the Contractual Currency with the amount of the currency of the judgment or order actually received by such party. The term "rate of exchange" includes, without limitation, any premiums and costs of exchange payable in connection with the purchase of or conversion into the Contractual Currency.
##
## (c) Separate Indemnities. To the extent permitted by applicable law, these indemnities constitute separate and independent obligations from the other obligations in this Agreement, will be enforceable as separate and independent causes of action, will apply notwithstanding any indulgence granted by the party to which any payment is owed and will not be affected by judgment being obtained or claim or proof being made for any other sums payable in respect of this Agreement.
##
## (d) Evidence of Loss. For tbe purpose of this Section 8, it will be sufficient for a party to demonstrate that it would have suffered a loss had an actual exchange or purchase been made.
##

###
## (f) No Waiver of Rights. A failure or delay in exercising any right, power or privilege in respect of this Agreement will not be presumed to operate as a waiver, and a single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege will not be presumed to preclude any subsequent or further exercise, of that right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

This representation will be deemed to be repeated by such party on each date on which a Transaction is entered into.
##
## (b) Neither party may change the Office through which it makes and receives payments or deliveries for the purpose of a Transaction without the prior written consent of the other party.
##
## (c) If a party is specified as a Multibranch Party in the Schedule, such Multibranch Party may make and receive payments or deliveries under any Transaction through any Office listed in the Schedule, and the Office through which it makes and receives payments or deliveries with respect to a Transaction will be specified in the relevant Confirmation.

For this purpose, Unpaid Amounts in respect of the Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions are to be excluded but, without limitation, any payment or delivery that would, but for the relevant Early Termination Date, have been required (assuming satisfaction of each applicable condition precedent) after that Early Termination Date is to be included. The Replacement Transaction would be subject to such documentation as such party and the Reference Market-maker may, in good faith, agree. The party making the determination (or its agent) will request each Reference Market-maker to provide its quotation to the extent reasonably practicable as of the same day and time (without regard to different time zones) on or as soon as reasonably practicable after the relevant Early Termination Date. The day and time as of which those quotations are to be
obtained will be selected in good faith by the party obliged to make a determination under Section 6(e), and, if each party is so obliged, after consultation with the other. If more than three quotations are provided, the Market Quotation will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations, without regard to the quotations having the highest and lowest values. If exactly three such quotations are provided, the Market Quotation will be the quotation remaining after disregarding the highest and lowest quotations. For this purpose, if more than one quotation has the same highest value or lowest value, then one of such quotations shall be disregarded.

" Reference Market-makers" means four leading dealers in the relevant market selected by the party determining a Market Quotation in good faith (a) from among dealers of the highest credit standing which satisfy all the criteria that such party applies generally at the time in deciding whether to offer or to make an extension of credit and (b) to the extent practicable, from among such dealers having an office in the same city.
" Relevant Jurisdiction" means, with respect to a party, the jurisdictions (a) in which the party is incorporated, organised, managed and controlled or considered to have its seat, (b) where an Office through which the party is acting for purposes of this Agreement is located, (c) in which the party executes this Agreement and (d) in relation to any payment, from or through which such payment is made.
" Scheduled Payment Date" means a date on which a payment or delivery is to be made under Section 2(a)(i) with respect to a Transaction.
" Set-off" means set-off, offset, combination of accounts, right of retention or withholding or similar right or requirement to which the payer of an amount under Section 6 is entitled or subject (whether arising under this Agreement, another contract, applicable law or otherwise) that is exercised by, or imposed on, such payer.
" Settlement Amount" means, with respect to a party and any Early Termination Date, the sum of: --
##
## (a) the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Market Quotations (whether positive or negative) for each Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions for which a Market Quotation is determined; and

The foreign exchange agent will, if only one party is obliged to make a determination under Section 6(e), be selected in good faith by that party and otherwise will be agreed by the parties.
" Termination Event" means an Illegality, a Tax Event or a Tax Event Upon Merger or, if specified to be applicable, a Credit Event Upon Merger or an Additional Termination Event.
" Termination Rate" means a rate per annum equal to the arithmetic mean of the cost (without proof or evidence of any actual cost) to each party (as certified by such party) if it were to fund or of funding such amounts.

Such amounts of interest will be calculated on the basis of daily compounding and the actual number of days elapsed. The fair market value of any obligation referred to in clause (b) above shall be reasonably determined by the party obliged to make the determination under Section 6(e) or, if each party is so obliged, it shall be the average of the Termination Currency Equivalents of the fair market values reasonably determined by both parties.

The arbitration tribunal shall not consolidate such arbitrations unless it determines that (x) there are issues of fact or law common to the various arbitrations so that a consolidated
proceeding would be more efficient than separate proceedings and (y) no party would be prejudiced as a result of such consolidation through undue delay or otherwise. In the event of different rulings on this question by the arbitration tribunal constituted hereunder and the tribunal constituted under any other Related Agreement, the ruling of the arbitration tribunal governing the first proceeding to have been filed shall control. In the event of the consolidation of one or more proceedings pursuant to this subsection, the arbitration tribunal governing the first such proceeding to have been filed shall govern the consolidated proceeding unless otherwise agreed by all parties to the proceedings being consolidated. Solely for purposes of this subsection (iii), (x) a proceeding shall be deemed to have been filed when the related demand for arbitration is served by the complaining party and (y) in the event that two proceedings shall have been filed on the same day, the proceeding involving the largest dollar amount in dispute shall be deemed to have been the first filed.
(iv) The arbitration award shall be final and binding on the parties. Judgment upon the award may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof or having jurisdiction over the relevant party or its assets."
### (viii) In Section 14: "Terminated Transactions" is amended on line 2 by deleting "all Transactions" and substituting "any or all Transactions terminated in accordance with Section 6(c)(ii)".

### (ix) The definition of "Loss" in Section 14 is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following new definition:
###
"'Loss' means, with respect to this Agreement or one or more Terminated Transactions, as the case may be, and a party, the Termination Currency Equivalent of an amount that party reasonably determines in good faith to be its total losses and costs (or gain, in which case expressed as a negative number) in connection with this Agreement or that Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions, as the case may be, including an amount equal to 100% of the Credit Support Amount outstanding on the Early Termination Date, any losses and costs relating to the provision of Credit Support to any third party, any losses and costs relating to any Loan, any losses or costs relating to any financing or similar fees, loss of bargain, cost of funding or, at the election of such party but without duplication, loss or cost incurred as a result of its terminating, liquidating, obtaining or reestablishing any hedge or related trading position (or any gain resulting from any of them). Loss includes losses and costs (or gains) in respect of any payment or delivery required to have been made (assuming satisfaction of each applicable condition precedent) on or before the relevant Early Termination Date and not made, except, so as to avoid duplication, if Section 6(e)(i)(1) or (3) or 6(e)(ii)(2)(A) applies. Loss does not include a party's legal fees and out-of-pocket expenses referred to under Section 11. A party will determine its Loss as of the relevant Early Termination Date, or, if that is not reasonably practicable, as of the earliest date thereafter as is reasonably practicable. A party may (but need not) determine its Loss by reference to quotations of relevant rates or prices from one or more leading dealers in the relevant markets."
### (x) Section 11 is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following new Section 11:
###
"A Defaulting Party will, on demand, indemnify and hold harmless the other party for and against all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including legal fees and Stamp Tax, incurred by such other party by reason of (i) the enforcement and protection of its rights under this Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which the Defaulting Party is a party, (ii) the enforcement or protection of its rights with respect to any outstanding Credit Support Amount, including any costs incurred in recovering any such amounts, or (iii) the early termination of any Transaction, including, but not limited to, costs of collection."
## (d) Set-Off. Section 6 of this Agreement shall be amended by the insertion of the following additional provision:
"(f) Set-Off. At any time or from time to time after an Event of Default or Termination Event occurs, the party ("X") that is the Non-defaulting Party or the party other than the Affected Party (and without prior notice to the Defaulting Party or the Affected Party ("Y")) may, at X's election, set off any or all amounts which Y or any Affiliate of Y owes to X or any Affiliate of X against any or all amounts which X or any Affiliate of X owes to Y or any Affiliate of Y (in each case, whether under this Agreement, any other agreement or otherwise, and whether or not then due, and irrespective of the currency, place of payment or booking office of the obligation); provided that any amount not then due which is included in such setoff shall be discounted to present value as at the time of setoff (to take account of the period between the time of setoff and the date on which such amount would have otherwise been due) at the applicable rate for that period determined by X in any commercially reasonable manner. X may give notice to the other party of any set-off effected under this Section  6(f).
For this purpose, any amount (or the relevant portion of such amounts) may be converted by X into the currency in which the other is denominated at the rate of exchange at which such party would be able, acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith, to purchase the relevant amount of such currency.
If an obligation is unascertained, X may in good faith estimate that obligation and set-off in respect of the estimate, subject to the relevant party accounting to the other when the obligation is ascertained.
Nothing in this Section 6(f) shall be effective to create a charge or other security interest. This Section 6(f) shall be without prejudice and in addition to any Lien to which any party is at any time otherwise entitled (whether by operation of law, contract or otherwise)."
## (e) Imaged Agreement. Any fully executed Agreement, Confirmation, Specified Agreement or other related document, or recording may be scanned and stored electronically, or stored on computer tapes and disks, as may be practicable (the "Imaged Agreement "). The Imaged Agreement, if introduced as evidence on paper, the Confirmation if introduced as evidence in automated facsimile form, any recording, if introduced as evidence in its original form and as transcribed onto paper, and all computer records of the foregoing, if introduced as evidence in printed format, in any judicial, arbitration, mediation or administrative proceedings, will be admissible as between the Parties to the same extent and under the same conditions as other business records originated and maintained in documentary form. Neither Party shall object to the admissibility of any Imaged Agreement (or photocopies of the transcription of such Imaged Agreement) on the basis that such were not originated or maintained in documentary form under either the hearsay rule, the best evidence rule or other rule of evidence. However, nothing herein shall be construed as a waiver of any other objection to the admissibility of such evidence.
##
## (f) (1) Market Disruption Events. Each of the following events shall constitute a Market Disruption Event hereunder:

Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, including clauses (f)(i) and f(ii) of the Gas Annex, Party A shall deliver an invoice to Party B for Gas on or about the 10th calendar day of each month beginning in the month immediately succeeding the month of commencement of the term of this Agreement. Each such invoice shall itemize all amounts owed by Party B for Gas delivered and received during the previous month and all other amounts due to Party A under this Agreement that have accrued in the previous month; provided , however , that any failure by Party A to deliver an invoice to Party B shall not in any way affect Party B's obligation to pay such amounts or the Due Date for the payment of such amounts. If the actual quantity of Gas delivered is not known by the invoice date, the invoice will be prepared based on the quantity of Gas that was scheduled for delivery in such month. The invoiced quantity will then be adjusted to reflect the actual delivered quantity of Gas on the following month's invoice or as soon thereafter as actual delivery information is available. Except as otherwise provided in Parts 9(b), (c), (e) and (f), Party B will pay each invoice on or before the 25th day of the month such invoice is received (the "_Gas Settlement Date "); provided , however_ , that such amounts shall not be considered past due if such amounts are paid to Party A on or before the 10th day of the third month following the month of delivery or accrual, as applicable (each such date, a "Gas Due Date ").
##
## (b) Payments for Storage Gas. Party B shall pay Party A for Storage Gas and all related charges on the Gas Settlement Date of the month following the month of delivery of such Storage Gas to Party B's customers; provided , however , that such amounts (other than amounts for Initial Storage Gas, which shall be netted pursuant to Part 8(b)(iii)) shall not be considered past due if such amounts are paid to Party A on or before the 10th day of the third month following the month of delivery to Party B's customers (each such date, a "Storage Gas Due Date "). Financing Fees shall accrue on the purchase price for Storage Gas and any related charges from (and excluding) the Gas Settlement Date in the month following the date such Storage Gas is delivered to the relevant LDC for credit to the relevant storage account (the "_Storage Financing Commencement Date_ ") to the date such purchase price is paid. All Financing Fees with respect to Storage Gas and related charges shall be due and payable on the 10th day of each month, commencing with the first month to occur after the Storage Financing Commencement Date. Any Storage Gas that has not been delivered to an LDC for delivery to Party B's customers on or prior to the Termination Date shall be required to be purchased by Party B (a "Required Purchase ") on the Termination Date (the "Required Purchase Date "). The contract price for Gas to be sold to Party B under a Required Purchase shall be the product of (i) the average Contract Price per MMBtu of the relevant Storage Gas weighted by volume and determined on a "last in last out" basis multiplied by (ii) the outstanding quantity (in MMBtus) of Storage Gas.
Payment for a Required Purchase shall not enjoy extended payment terms.
Accordingly, amounts due and unpaid on the Required Purchase Date shall be immediately overdue if not paid on the Required Purchase Date and shall accrue interest at the Default Rate.
##
## (c) Swap Payments. Promptly after the end of each Calculation Period for each outstanding Gas Swap, Party A shall deliver to Party B invoices in respect of Gas Swap settlement payments that are due with respect to such Transactions. Gas Swap settlement payments shall be due on the fifth Business Day after the end of each relevant Calculation Period (the "_Gas Swap Settlement Date "); provided , however,_ that Gas Swap settlement payments due from Party B shall not be deemed past due so long as such payments are made by the Gas Due Date that occurs in the third month following the end of the applicable Calculation Period.
##

##
## (d) Option Payments. Unless otherwise required by Party A, the premium payment for Option Transactions will be due on the next Gas Settlement Date after the Option Transaction is entered into; provided , however , that any such premium payment shall not include the Gas Adder or other fees and shall not be deemed past due so long as such payment is made by the Gas Due Date that applies to such Gas Settlement Date. Settlement payments for exercised Option Transactions shall be subject to the payment terms applicable to the underlying transaction. For the avoidance of doubt, the Contract Price for Gas delivered pursuant to the exercise of any physically settled Option Transactions and Option Transactions on Gas Swaps will include the relevant Gas Adder.
##
## (e) Financing Fees. Party B shall pay Financing Fees with respect to all Outstanding Amounts. Financing Fees shall accrue on each Outstanding Amount from and excluding the Settlement Date or other date on which such Outstanding Amount was originally due for payment and through and including the date such amount is paid; provided , however , that, with respect to the amounts due for Storage Gas, Financing Fees shall accrue in accordance with Part 9(b).
Financing Fees shall be payable monthly in arrears on the 10th day of each month (the "Financing Fee Settlement Date "); provided, however, that Financing Fees shall not be deemed past due so long as such payments are made by the Gas Due Date that occurs in the third month following the applicable Financing Fee Settlement Date.
##
## (f) Credit Support Fees. With respect to any outstanding Credit Support Amount, Party B shall pay to Party A a Credit Support Fee. The Credit Support Fee shall be calculated daily and shall be paid monthly in arrears on each Gas Settlement Date; provided , however , that the Credit Support Fee shall not be deemed past due so long as payment is made on or prior to the next occurring Gas Due Date.

##
### (i) On the Closing Date, Party B shall cause SocGen to novate SocGen's positions under the outstanding Hedging Transactions set forth on Exhibit 10(a)(i) to Party A (the "SG Novated Transactions ").

If SocGen requires a payment in exchange for, or as a condition to, executing any novation, Party B shall make such payment to SocGen (such payments, the "SG Novation Payments ").
###
### (ii) On the Closing Date, Party A shall inform Party B of the aggregate mark-to-market exposure that Party A has assumed in connection with the SG Novated Transactions (the "SG Notional Amount "). In addition to any other payments required to be made by Party B in connection therewith, Party B shall pay to Party A, from and including the Closing Date to and excluding the latest settlement date scheduled to occur with respect to the SG Novated Transactions, a monthly fee (the "SG Exposure Fee ") on the SG Notional Amount. The SG Exposure Fee for each month and the formula used to calculate each such monthly amount shall be set forth on Exhibit 10(a)(ii). The SG Exposure Fee shall be payable monthly in arrears, on the 10th day of each month (each, an "Exposure Fee Due Date "); provided , however , that each such payment shall not be considered past due if such payment is paid to Party A on or before the 10th day of the third month following the applicable Exposure Fee Due Date.
###
### (iii) The parties acknowledge and agree that, in respect of the SG Novated Transactions, (A) the fee paid to Party A pursuant to clause (v) of this Part 10(a) shall be in lieu of any Gas Adder and Sleeve Adder that otherwise would have applied to such Transactions, and (B) the aggregate notional amount of the SG Novated Transactions will be counted toward the Minimum Gas Quantity for the initial Contract Year.
###

### (iv) Party B agrees that, to secure its obligations under the SG Novated Transactions, it shall deliver to Party A on the Closing Date cash in an amount equal to that portion of the SG Notional Amount that Party A attributes to the mark-to-market exposure for calculation periods under the SG Novated Transactions that commence more than one calendar year from the Closing Date (each, a "SG Future Calculation Period "). All such cash shall be held by Party A in the Swap Note Sub Account; provided , however , that, on each Gas Swap Settlement Date following October 31, 2009 and as long as no Default or Potential Termination Event has occurred and is continuing with respect to Party B, Party A shall transfer from the Swap Note Sub Account to the Party A Sub Account an amount equal to the mark-to-market exposure that Party A, in accordance with the preceding sentence, attributed to the SG Future Calculation Period occurring 11 months following such Gas Swap Settlement.
###
### (v) On the Closing Date, and in consideration for Party A entering into the SG Novated Transactions and the SG Sleeve Transactions, Party B shall pay to Party A a fee in an amount equal to $600,000.
###
## (b) Third Party Transactions.
##
### (i) Within 30 days of the Closing Date, Party B shall either (A) terminate and liquidate or (B) novate to Party A, as the case may be, all of the outstanding Hedging Transactions with third parties that are listed on Exhibit 10(b)(i). With respect to such transactions on Exhibit 10(b)(i) that Party B elects to terminate and liquidate (such transactions, the "_Third Party Transactions_ "), such terminations and liquidations may result in termination payments to be made by Party B to one or more third-parties at the relevant time of such terminations and liquidations in amounts to be negotiated between each such third party and Party A (such payments, the "_Third Party Liquidation Payments_ ").
###
### (ii) Concurrently with the termination and liquidation of each Third Party Transaction, Party A shall enter into a Hedging Transaction with Party B that corresponds with such terminated Third Party Transaction (each such corresponding transaction, a "Corresponding Third Party Transaction ") having the same notional quantity, floating price and remaining tenor; provided , however , that the fixed price applicable to each such Hedging Transaction shall be the fixed price used to calculate the Third Party Liquidation Payment for the corresponding terminated Third Party Transaction.
###
### (iii) With respect to such transactions on Exhibit 10(b)(i) that Party B elects to novate to Party A (the "Third Party Novation Transactions "), concurrently with the novation of such transactions, Party A and each relevant third party shall enter into back-to-back offsetting Hedging Transactions having the same notional quantities, floating prices and remaining tenors with respect to each Third Party Novation Transaction and otherwise on terms satisfactory to Party A in its sole discretion. If a third party requires a payment in exchange for, or as a condition to, executing any novation, Party B shall make such payment to the relevant third party (such payments, the "Third Party Novation Payments ").
###
### (iv) On the Closing Date, Party A shall inform Party B of the then-current aggregate mark-to-market exposure associated with each transaction listed on Exhibit 10(b)(i) (each, a "Third Party Notional Amount "). In addition to any other payments required to be made by Party B in connection herewith, Party B shall pay to Party A, from and including the Closing Date, to and excluding the latest settlement date scheduled to occur with respect to each such transaction, a monthly fee (the "Third Party Exposure Fees ") on the relevant Third Party Notional Amount associated with each such transaction; provided , however , that, once a transaction listed on Exhibit 10(b)(i) becomes a Third Party Transaction (i.e., is terminated and liquidated), Third Party Exposure Fees shall cease to accrue on the Third Party Notional Amount attributable to such transaction. The formula used to calculate all Third Party Exposure Fees shall be set forth on Exhibit 10(b)(iv). All Third Party Exposure Fees shall be payable monthly in arrears on each Exposure Fee Due Date; provided , however , that each such payment shall not be considered past due if such payment is paid to Party A on or before the 10th day of the third month following the applicable Exposure Fee Due Date.
###
### 34
###
###
### (v) On and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and to enable Party B to pay any Third Party Liquidation Payments, any SG Novation Payments and any Third Party Novation Payments, Party A shall make one or more loans to Party B (each such loan, a "Loan ") on and after the Closing Date and in amounts equal to any SG Novation Payments, Third Party Novation Payments and/or Third Party Liquidation Payments; provided, that, the commitment of Party A to make any such Loans shall expire on the 30th day following the Closing Date.

All such cash shall be held by Party A in the Swap Note Sub Account; provided , however , that, on each Gas Swap Settlement Date following October 31, 2009 and as long as no Default or Potential Termination Event has occurred and is continuing with respect to Party B, Party A shall transfer from the Swap Note Sub Account to the Party A Sub Account an amount equal to that portion of the Third Party Notional Amount of each such transaction attributed to the Third Party Future Calculation Period occurring eleven months following such Gas Swap Settlement Date.
###
### (vii) If Party A and Party B do not agree on a flat fee to be paid by Party B to Party A for entering into the Corresponding Third Party Transactions and the Third Party Novation Transactions, Party B shall pay to Party A the applicable Gas Adder in respect of the notional amounts relating to each such Corresponding Third Party Transaction and each such Third Party Novation Transaction. The parties further agree that the aggregate notional amounts of the Corresponding Third Party Transactions and the Third Party Novation Transactions shall be counted toward the Minimum Gas Quantity for the initial Contract Year.
###
## (c) Loan Accounting.
##
### (i) Party A shall record in its records the date and amount of each of the Loans and each repayment thereof. The aggregate unpaid principal amount so recorded shall be rebuttably presumptive evidence of the principal amount of the Loans owing and unpaid. The failure to so record any such amount or any error in so recording any such amount shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligations of Party B hereunder or under any Promissory Note to repay the principal amount of the Loans hereunder, together with all interest accruing thereon.
###
### (ii) At the request of Party A, the Loans shall be evidenced by Promissory Notes, substantially in the form of Exhibit 10(c)(ii), with appropriate insertions, payable to the order of Party A in a face principal amount equal to the principal amount of the applicable Loan.

##
### (i) Party B promises to pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Loan for the period commencing on the date of such Loan until such Loan is paid in full at the applicable rate per annum set forth on Exhibit 10(d)(i) hereto with respect to such Loan; provided , that (A) at any time an Event of Default exists, the applicable rate of interest corresponding to the Loan shall be the Default Rate and (B) any such increase may thereafter be rescinded by Party A. In no event shall charges constituting interest payable by Party B to Party A exceed the maximum amount or the rate permitted under any Applicable Law, and if any such part or provision of this Agreement is in contravention of any such Applicable Law, such part or provision shall be deemed amended to conform thereto. Amounts payable as the SG Exposure Fee and Third Party Exposure Fees shall, for the purposes of this clause (i), be considered interest payable on the SG Notional Amount and the Third Party Notional Amount, respectively. Accordingly, the proviso set forth above shall apply, and shall be calculated on the SG Notional Amount and the Third Party Notional Amount.
###
### 35
###
###
### (ii) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on the 10th day of each month during the term of this Agreement; provided, however, that each such payment shall not be considered past due if such payment is paid to Party A on or before the Gas Due Date that relates to the Gas Settlement Date that occurs during the month such payment was originally due. After maturity and at any time an Event of Default exists, all accrued interest on all Loans shall be payable in cash and on demand at the rates specified in Part 10(d)(i).
###
## (e) Loan Prepayments. Party B may not make any prepayment on any Loan hereunder.
##
## (f) Loan Repayments. The Loans shall be paid at the times and in the amounts set forth on Exhibit 10(d)(i) attached hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the outstanding principal balance of the Loans shall be paid in full on their respective Maturity Dates; provided, however, that each such payment shall not be considered past due if such payment is paid to Party A on or before the Gas Due Date that relates to the Gas Settlement Date that occurs during the month such payment was originally due.
##
## (g) Manner of Funding; Alternate Funding Offices. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Party A shall be entitled to fund and maintain its funding of all or any part of the Loans at its sole discretion. Party A may, if it so elects, fulfill its commitment to make any Loan by causing any Affiliate of Party A to make such Loan; provided , that in such event for the purposes of this Agreement such Loan shall be deemed to have been made by Party A and the obligation of Party B to repay such Loan shall nevertheless be to Party A and shall be deemed held by it, to the extent of such Loan, for the account of such Affiliate.
##
## (h) Loans Generally. The parties agree that all Loans by Party A to Party B hereunder shall be deemed Transactions entered into under this Agreement.
##
## (i) Security Interests and Collateral. Simultaneously with the novation or liquidation of transactions under Part 10(a) or Part 10(b), Party B shall cause SocGen or the applicable third party to such transaction to (A) assign to Party A any security interest held by SocGen or such third party (in any capacity) in any assets owned by Party B or any Specified Entity of Party B, including any transactions or agreements between Party B and any Customer of Party B; and (B) transfer any existing collateral securing such transactions held by SocGen or such third party (to the extent such collateral was not liquidated in connection with the close-out and liquidation of such transactions).
