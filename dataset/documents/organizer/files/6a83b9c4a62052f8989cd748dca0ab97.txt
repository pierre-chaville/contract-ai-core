This Part 5(g) shall replace any "Express Provisions" where "Express Provisions" means any provisions expressly set out in any confirmation of a Transaction that supplements, forms a part of, and is subject to, this ISDA Master Agreement; that provide for amendments to (i) any Payer Tax Representation contained in this ISDA Master Agreement, (ii) Section 2(d) of this ISDA Master Agreement, or (iii) the definition of "Indemnifiable Tax" in this ISDA Master Agreement, in each case, only in relation to FATCA Withholding Tax.
(h)         Conditions Precedent. Section 2(a)(iii)(1) shall be amended by deleting the words "or Potential Event of Default".  In addition, for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(iii) of this Agreement applies to each obligation of each party under Section 2(a)(i) of this Agreement, after the application of Section 2(c) of this Agreement or, if applicable, paragraph (d) of Part 6 of this Schedule, where the parties shall be deemed to have agreed to netting therein.
(i)          Amendment to Section 2. Section 2 of the Agreement shall be amended to add at the end a new Section 2(e), reading in its entirety as follows:
"(e)       Condition End Date.
(i)          If an Event of Default occurs, the Defaulting Party may, by notice to the Non‑defaulting Party identifying the Event of Default and confirming its occurrence, specify that clause (ii) will apply to that Event of Default.
(ii)         If this clause (ii) applies to an Event of Default, then the condition precedent specified in Section 2(a)(iii)(1) with respect to that Event of Default will cease to be a condition precedent to each obligation of the Non‑defaulting Party on the relevant Condition End Date.  Any obligation that would have been payable or deliverable by the Non‑defaulting Party but for Section 2(a)(iii)(1) will become payable or deliverable on the first Local Business Day falling after the Condition End Date (together with interest payable on demand in accordance with Section 9(h)(i)(3)(A) or compensation and interest payable on demand in accordance with Section 9(h)(i)(4)(A), as the case may be).
(iii)        Subject to clause (iv) below, if, after a party has given a notice under clause (i) above with respect to an Event of Default, another Event of Default occurs with respect to that party (and such other Event of Default does not arise out of the same facts and circumstances as a prior Event of Default), then, with respect to the earlier Event of Default, no Condition End Date will occur and therefore clause (ii) will not apply.  This will not affect the right of that party to give a notice under clause (i) in respect of the subsequent Event of Default.  This clause (iii) is without prejudice to the right of the Defaulting Party to give a new notice to the Non‑defaulting Party under clause (i) with respect to the earlier Event of Default.
(iv)        If the Defaulting Party has given a notice under clause (i) above in respect of an Event of Default under Section 5(a)(vii), then clause (iii) will not apply."
Section 14 of the Agreement is amended to add in the appropriate alphabetical position a new definition of "Condition End Date", reading in its entirety as follows:
""Condition End Date" means, with respect to an Event of Default, the day falling 90 days after a notice given by the Defaulting Party under Section 2(e)(i) is effective if the Event of Default is still continuing on that day."
(j)          ISDA Dodd Frank Protocols. The parties agree that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the ISDA August 2012 DF Protocol Agreement (as published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. on August 13, 2012) entered into by the parties (the "August DF Protocol Agreement") and the ISDA March 2013 DF Protocol Agreement (as published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. on March 22, 2013) entered into by the parties (the "March DF Protocol Agreement") (together, the "Protocol Agreements"), this Agreement shall constitute a "Protocol Covered Agreement" for all purposes under the Protocol Agreements.
(k)         ISDA 2018 U.S. Resolution Stay Protocol. Each party agrees that it has adhered to the ISDA 2018 U.S. Resolution Stay Protocol (the "ISDA U.S.
Stay Protocol") prior to the date hereof. The parties agree that the terms of the ISDA U.S. Stay Protocol are incorporated into and form a part of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be deemed a Protocol Covered Agreement for purposes thereof.  For purposes of incorporating the ISDA U.S. Stay Protocol, Party A shall be deemed to be a Regulated Entity and Party B shall be deemed to be an Adhering Party. In the event of any inconsistencies between this Agreement and the ISDA U.S. Stay Protocol, the ISDA U.S. Stay Protocol will prevail.
(l)          Confirmation Procedures. Each confirming document, acknowledgment or other evidence intended by the parties to be effective for the purpose of confirming or evidencing a Transaction, whether created by delivery or exchange of written terms that match, or by making available written terms in a manner that permits the recipient to review and/or accept the terms, or by delivery to an agent or service provider, or via electronic messaging system, electronic communication network, or web-based platform that confirms the matching of such terms, shall constitute a "Confirmation" as referred to in this Agreement, provided that both parties agree in writing or by their course of conduct to use such method with respect to Transactions or certain types of Transactions. The parties expect to execute and deliver Confirmations for Transactions within the timeframes specified in CFTC Rule 23.501, to the extent applicable. Failure of the parties to confirm a Transaction within such timeframes, however, shall not be a basis for voiding or rescinding such Transaction and shall not affect the validity or enforceability of such Transaction.
(m)        Limitations on Confirmation Override.  Notwithstanding Section 1(b) of this Agreement (as modified in Part 5(e)(i) above), the terms of a Confirmation shall not override any of the provisions identified below, and in the event of any inconsistency the terms of such provision and not the Confirmation shall govern, unless the Confirmation is executed by authorized signatories of Party A and Party B:
(i)         Part 1 of this Schedule ("Termination Provisions");
(ii)        Section 5 of this Agreement ("Events of Default and Termination Events"), as supplemented and amended by Part 1 of this Schedule;
(iii)       Section 6 of this Agreement ("Early Termination; Close-Out Netting"), as supplemented and amended by this Schedule; or
(iv)        Any Credit Support Document.
(n)         Limitation of Liability.  NO PARTY SHALL BE REQUIRED TO PAY OR BE LIABLE FOR INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (WHETHER OR NOT ARISING FROM ITS NEGLIGENCE) TO ANY OTHER PARTY EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE PAYMENTS REQUIRED TO BE MADE PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT ARE DEEMED TO BE SUCH DAMAGES.  IF AND TO THE EXTENT ANY PAYMENT REQUIRED TO BE MADE PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT IS DEEMED TO CONSTITUTE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES, THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ACTUAL DAMAGES ARE DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE AND THAT SUCH PAYMENT IS INTENDED TO BE A REASONABLE APPROXIMATION OF THE AMOUNT OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOT A PENALTY.
(o)         Benchmarks.  The parties acknowledge that in the event they enter into any Transaction referencing a benchmark that is to be demised pursuant to a regulatory initiative (an "Old Benchmark") they will need to amend the terms of that Transaction to account for the demise of the Old Benchmark.  They agree to engage in good faith discussions to agree on a replacement benchmark, and mitigate any economic and operational consequences of such amendment. They further agree to consult on these matters in a timely manner ahead of the demise of the Old Benchmark. Reference shall be made to prevailing market standards and practices, including any ISDA published supplements and protocols. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Transaction is hedging a Loan under the Credit Agreement, the parties agree to use good faith efforts to select a replacement benchmark for the Transaction that matches the replacement benchmark provided for in the Credit Agreement with respect to such Loan.
