2002 MASTER AGREEMENT
dated as of November 30, 2021
between
Macquarie Bank Limited (AFS Licence: 237502) ("Party A") 	 and 	 Each Party B specified on Appendix A to this Agreement, severally and not jointly (each a "Party B")
have entered and/or anticipate entering into one or more transactions (each a "Transaction") that are or will be governed by this 2002 Master Agreement, which includes the schedule (the "Schedule"), and the documents and other confirming evidence (each a "Confirmation") exchanged between the parties or otherwise effective for the purpose of confirming or evidencing those Transactions. This 2002 Master Agreement and the Schedule are together referred to as this "Master Agreement".
Accordingly, the parties agree as follows:--
1.                   Interpretation
(a)                 Definitions. The terms defined in Section 14 and elsewhere in this Master Agreement will have the meanings therein specified for the purpose of this Master Agreement.
(b)                 Inconsistency.   In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of the Schedule and the other provisions of this Master Agreement, the Schedule will prevail. In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of any Confirmation and this Master Agreement, such Confirmation will prevail for the purpose of the relevant Transaction.
(c)                 Single Agreement. All Transactions are entered into in reliance on the fact that this Master Agreement and all Confirmations form a single agreement between the parties (collectively referred to as this "Agreement"), and the parties would not otherwise enter into any Transactions.
2.                   Obligations
(a)                 General Conditions.
(i)                   Each party will make each payment or delivery specified in each Confirmation to be made by it, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement.
(ii)                 Payments under this Agreement will be made on the due date for value on that date in the place of the account specified in the relevant Confirmation or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement, in freely transferable funds and in the manner customary for payments in the required currency. Where settlement is by delivery (that is, other than by payment), such delivery will be made for receipt on the due date in the manner customary for the relevant obligation unless otherwise specified in the relevant Confirmation or elsewhere in this Agreement.

(iii)                Each obligation of each party under Section 2(a)(i) is subject to (1) the condition precedent that no Event of Default or Potential Event of Default with respect to the other party has occurred and is continuing, (2) the condition precedent that no Early Termination Date in respect of the relevant Transaction has occurred or been effectively designated and (3) each other condition specified in this Agreement to be a condition precedent for the purpose of this Section 2(a)(iii).
(b)                 Change of Account. Either party may change its account for receiving a payment or delivery by giving notice to the other party at least five Local Business Days prior to the Scheduled Settlement Date for the payment or delivery to which such change applies unless such other party gives timely notice of a reasonable objection to such change.
(c)                 Netting of Payments. If on any date amounts would otherwise be payable:--
(i)                   in the same currency; and
(ii)                 in respect of the same Transaction,
by each party to the other, then, on such date, each party's obligation to make payment of any such amount will be automatically satisfied and discharged and, if the aggregate amount that would otherwise have been payable by one party exceeds the aggregate amount that would otherwise have been payable by the other party, replaced by an obligation upon the party by which the larger aggregate amount would have been payable to pay to the other party the excess of the larger aggregate amount over the smaller aggregate amount.
The parties may elect in respect of two or more Transactions that a net amount and payment obligation will be determined in respect of all amounts payable on the same date in the same currency in respect of those Transactions, regardless of whether such amounts are payable in respect of the same Transaction. The election may be made in the Schedule or any Confirmation by specifying that "Multiple Transaction Payment Netting" applies to the Transactions identified as being subject to the election (in which case clause (ii) above will not apply to such Transactions). If Multiple Transaction Payment Netting is applicable to Transactions, it will apply to those Transactions with effect from the starting date specified in the Schedule or such Confirmation, or, if a starting date is not specified in the Schedule or such Confirmation, the starting date otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. This election may be made separately for different groups of Transactions and will apply separately to each pairing of Offices through which the parties make and receive payments or deliveries.
(d)                 Deduction or Withholding for Tax.
(i)                   Gross-Up. All payments under this Agreement will be made without any deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax unless such deduction or withholding is required by any applicable law, as modified by the practice of any relevant governmental revenue authority, then in effect. If a party is so required to deduct or withhold, then that party ("X") will:--
(1)                 promptly notify the other party ("Y") of such requirement;
(2)                 pay to the relevant authorities the full amount required to be deducted or withheld (including the full amount required to be deducted or withheld from any additional amount paid by X to Y under this Section 2(d)) promptly upon the earlier of determining that such deduction or withholding is required or receiving notice that such amount has been assessed against Y;
(3)                 promptly forward to Y an official receipt (or a certified copy), or other documentation reasonably acceptable to Y, evidencing such payment to such authorities; and
(4)                 if such Tax is an Indemnifiable Tax, pay to Y, in addition to the payment to which Y is otherwise entitled under this Agreement, such additional amount as is necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by Y (free and clear of Indemnifiable Taxes, whether assessed against X or Y) will equal the full amount Y would have received had no such deduction or withholding been required. However, X will not be required to pay any additional amount to Y to the extent that it would not be required to be paid but for:--
ISDA Ò2002

(A)                the failure by Y to comply with or perform any agreement contained in Section 4(a)(i), 4(a)(iii) or 4(d); or
(B)                the failure of a representation made by Y pursuant to Section 3(f) to be accurate and true unless such failure would not have occurred but for (I) any action taken by a taxing authority, or brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, after a Transaction is entered into (regardless of whether such action is taken or brought with respect to a party to this Agreement) or (II) a Change in Tax Law.
(ii)                  Liability. If:--
(1)                 X is required by any applicable law, as modified by the practice of any relevant governmental revenue authority, to make any deduction or withholding in respect of which X would not be required to pay an additional amount to Y under Section 2(d)(i)(4);
(2)                 X does not so deduct or withhold; and
(3)                 a liability resulting from such Tax is assessed directly against X,
then, except to the extent Y has satisfied or then satisfies the liability resulting from such Tax, Y will promptly pay to X the amount of such liability (including any related liability for interest, but including any related liability for penalties only if Y has failed to comply with or perform any agreement contained in Section 4(a)(i), 4(a)(iii) or 4(d)).
3.                   Representations
Each party makes the representations contained in Sections 3(a), 3(b), 3(c), 3(d), 3(e) and 3(f) and, if specified in the Schedule as applying, 3(g) to the other party (which representations will be deemed to be repeated by each party on each date on which a Transaction is entered into and, in the case of the representations in Section 3(f), at all times until the termination of this Agreement). If any "Additional Representation" is specified in the Schedule or any Confirmation as applying, the party or parties specified for such Additional Representation will make and, if applicable, be deemed to repeat such Additional Representation at the time or times specified for such Additional Representation.

(iii)                No Violation or Conflict.

(iv)               Consents.

(b)                 Absence of Certain Events. No Event of Default or Potential Event of Default or, to its knowledge, Termination Event with respect to it has occurred and is continuing and no such event or circumstance would occur as a result of its entering into or performing its obligations under this Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which it is a party.

There is not pending or, to its knowledge, threatened against it, any of its Credit Support Providers or any of its applicable Specified Entities any action, suit or proceeding at law or in equity or before any court, tribunal, governmental body, agency or official or any arbitrator that is likely to affect the legality, validity or enforceability against it of this Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which it is a party or its ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement or such Credit Support Document.
(d)                 Accuracy of Specified Information.

(a)                 Furnish Specified Information. It will deliver to the other party or, in certain cases under clause (iii) below, to such government or taxing authority as the other party reasonably directs:--

(ii)                  any other documents specified in the Schedule or any Confirmation; and

in each case by the date specified in the Schedule or such Confirmation or, if none is specified, as soon as reasonably practicable.

(c)                 Comply With Laws. It will comply in all material respects with all applicable laws and orders to which it may be subject if failure so to comply would materially impair its ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which it is a party.

Subject to Section 11, it will pay any Stamp Tax levied or imposed upon it or in respect of its execution or performance of this Agreement by a jurisdiction in which it is incorporated, organised, managed and controlled or considered to have its seat, or where an Office through which it is acting for the purpose of this Agreement is located ("Stamp Tax Jurisdiction"), and will indemnify the other party against any Stamp Tax levied or imposed upon the other party or in respect of the other party's execution or performance of this Agreement by any such Stamp Tax Jurisdiction which is not also a Stamp Tax Jurisdiction with respect to the other party.
5.                   Events of Default and Termination Events
(a)                 Events of Default. The occurrence at any time with respect to a party or, if applicable, any Credit Support Provider of such party or any Specified Entity of such party of any of the following events constitutes (subject to Sections 5(c) and 6(e)(iv)) an event of default (an "Event of Default") with respect to such party:
(i)                   Failure to Pay or Deliver. Failure by the party to make, when due, any payment under this Agreement or delivery under Section 2(a)(i) or 9(h)(i)(2) or (4) required to be made by it if such failure is not remedied on or before the first Local Business Day in the case of any such payment or the first Local Delivery Day in the case of any such delivery after, in each case, notice of such failure is given to the party;
(ii)                 Breach of Agreement; Repudiation of Agreement.

(2)                 the party disaffirms, disclaims, repudiates or rejects, in whole or in part, or challenges the validity of, this Master Agreement, any Confirmation executed and delivered by that party or any Transaction evidenced by such a Confirmation (or such action is taken by any person or entity appointed or empowered to operate it or act on its behalf);
(iii)                Credit Support Default.
(1)                 Failure by the party or any Credit Support Provider of such party to comply with or perform any agreement or obligation to be complied with or performed by it in accordance with any Credit Support Document if such failure is continuing after any applicable grace period has elapsed;
(2)                 the expiration or termination of such Credit Support Document or the failing or ceasing of such Credit Support Document, or any security interest granted by such party or such Credit Support Provider to the other party pursuant to any such Credit Support Document, to be in full force and effect for the purpose of this Agreement (in each case other than in accordance with its terms) prior to the satisfaction of all obligations of such party under each Transaction to which such Credit Support Document relates without the written consent of the other party; or

A representation (other than a representation under Section 3(e) or 3(f)) made or repeated or deemed to have been made or repeated by the party or any Credit Support Provider of such party in this Agreement or any Credit Support Document proves to have been incorrect or misleading in any material respect when made or repeated or deemed to have been made or repeated;

(1)                 defaults (other than by failing to make a delivery) under a Specified Transaction or any credit support arrangement relating to a Specified Transaction and, after giving effect to any applicable notice requirement or grace period, such default results in a liquidation of, an acceleration of obligations under, or an early termination of, that Specified Transaction;
(2)                 defaults, after giving effect to any applicable notice requirement or grace period, in making any payment due on the last payment or exchange date of, or any payment on early termination of, a Specified Transaction (or, if there is no applicable notice requirement or grace period, such default continues for at least one Local Business Day);

The party or any Credit Support Provider of such party consolidates or amalgamates with, or merges with or into, or transfers all or substantially all its assets to, or reorganises, reincorporates or reconstitutes into or as, another entity and, at the time of such consolidation, amalgamation, merger, transfer, reorganisation, reincorporation or reconstitution:--

ISDA Ò2002

(1)                 for the Office through which such party (which will be the Affected Party) makes and receives payments or deliveries with respect to such Transaction to perform any absolute or contingent obligation to make a payment or delivery in respect of such Transaction, to receive a payment or delivery in respect of such Transaction or to comply with any other material provision of this Agreement relating to such Transaction; or
(2)                 for such party or any Credit Support Provider of such party (which will be the Affected Party) to perform any absolute or contingent obligation to make a payment or delivery which such party or Credit Support Provider has under any Credit Support Document relating to such Transaction, to receive a payment or delivery under such Credit Support Document or to comply with any other material provision of such Credit Support Document;
(ii)                 Force Majeure Event. After giving effect to any applicable provision, disruption fallback or remedy specified in, or pursuant to, the relevant Confirmation or elsewhere in this Agreement, by reason of force majeure or act of state occurring after a Transaction is entered into, on any day:--
(1)                 the Office through which such party (which will be the Affected Party) makes and receives payments or deliveries with respect to such Transaction is prevented from performing any absolute or contingent obligation to make a payment or delivery in respect of such Transaction, from receiving a payment or delivery in respect of such Transaction or from complying with any other material provision of this Agreement relating to such Transaction (or would be so prevented if such payment, delivery or compliance were required on that day), or it becomes impossible or impracticable for such Office so to perform, receive or comply (or it would be impossible or impracticable for such Office so to perform, receive or comply if such payment, delivery or compliance were required on that day); or
(2)                 such party or any Credit Support Provider of such party (which will be the Affected Party) is prevented from performing any absolute or contingent obligation to make a payment or delivery which such party or Credit Support Provider has under any Credit Support Document relating to such Transaction, from receiving a payment or delivery under such Credit Support Document or from complying with any other material provision of such Credit Support Document (or would be so prevented if such payment, delivery or compliance were required on that day), or it becomes impossible or impracticable for such party or Credit Support Provider so to perform, receive or comply (or it would be impossible or impracticable for such party or Credit Support Provider so to perform, receive or comply if such payment, delivery or compliance were required on that day),
so long as the force majeure or act of state is beyond the control of such Office, such party or such Credit Support Provider, as appropriate, and such Office, party or Credit Support Provider could not, after using all reasonable efforts (which will not require such party or Credit Support Provider to incur a loss, other than immaterial, incidental expenses), overcome such prevention, impossibility or impracticability;
(iii)                Tax Event.  Due to (1) any action taken by a taxing authority, or brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, after a Transaction is entered into (regardless of whether such action is taken or brought with respect to a party to this Agreement) or (2) a Change in Tax Law, the party (which will be the Affected Party) will, or there is a substantial likelihood that it will, on the next succeeding Scheduled Settlement Date (A) be required to pay to the other party an additional amount in respect of an Indemnifiable Tax under Section 2(d)(i)(4) (except in respect of interest under Section 9(h)) or (B) receive a payment from which an amount is required to be deducted or withheld for or on account of a Tax (except in respect of interest under Section 9(h)) and no additional amount is required to be paid in respect of such Tax under Section 2(d)(i)(4) (other than by reason of Section 2(d)(i)(4)(A) or (B));

(iv)               Tax Event Upon Merger. The party (the "Burdened Party") on the next succeeding Scheduled Settlement Date will either (1) be required to pay an additional amount in respect of an Indemnifiable Tax under Section 2(d)(i)(4) (except in respect of interest under Section 9(h)) or (2) receive a payment from which an amount has been deducted or withheld for or on account of any Tax in respect of which the other party is not required to pay an additional amount (other than by reason of Section 2(d)(i)(4)(A) or (B)), in either case as a result of a party consolidating or amalgamating with, or merging with or into, or transferring all or substantially all its assets (or any substantial part of the assets comprising the business conducted by it as of the date of this Master Agreement) to, or reorganising, reincorporating or reconstituting into or as, another entity (which will be the Affected Party) where such action does not constitute a Merger Without Assumption;
(v)                 Credit Event Upon Merger. If "Credit Event Upon Merger" is specified in the Schedule as applying to the party, a Designated Event (as defined below) occurs with respect to such party, any Credit Support Provider of such party or any applicable Specified Entity of such party (in each case, "X") and such Designated Event does not constitute a Merger Without Assumption, and the creditworthiness of X or, if applicable, the successor, surviving or transferee entity of X, after taking into account any applicable Credit Support Document, is materially weaker immediately after the occurrence of such Designated Event than that of X immediately prior to the occurrence of such Designated Event (and, in any such event, such party or its successor, surviving or transferee entity, as appropriate, will be the Affected Party). A "Designated Event" with respect to X means that:--
(1)                 X consolidates or amalgamates with, or merges with or into, or transfers all or substantially all its assets (or any substantial part of the assets comprising the business conducted by X as of the date of this Master Agreement) to, or reorganises, reincorporates or reconstitutes into or as, another entity;
(2)                 any person, related group of persons or entity acquires directly or indirectly the beneficial ownership of (A) equity securities having the power to elect a majority of the board of directors (or its equivalent) of X or (B) any other ownership interest enabling it to exercise control of X; or
(3)                 X effects any substantial change in its capital structure by means of the issuance, incurrence or guarantee of debt or the issuance of
(A) preferred stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for debt or preferred stock or (B) in the case of entities other than corporations, any other form of ownership interest; or
(vi)               Additional Termination Event. If any "Additional Termination Event" is specified in the Schedule or any Confirmation as applying, the occurrence of such event (and, in such event, the Affected Party or Affected Parties will be as specified for such Additional Termination Event in the Schedule or such Confirmation).
(c)                 Hierarchy of Events.
(i)                   An event or circumstance that constitutes or gives rise to an Illegality or a Force Majeure Event will not, for so long as that is the case, also constitute or give rise to an Event of Default under Section 5(a)(i), 5(a)(ii)(1) or 5(a)(iii)(1) insofar as such event or circumstance relates to the failure to make any payment or delivery or a failure to comply with any other material provision of this Agreement or a Credit Support Document, as the case may be.
(ii)                 Except in circumstances contemplated by clause (i) above, if an event or circumstance which would otherwise constitute or give rise to an Illegality or a Force Majeure Event also constitutes an Event of Default or any other Termination Event, it will be treated as an Event of Default or such other Termination Event, as the case may be, and will not constitute or give rise to an Illegality or a Force Majeure Event.
ISDA Ò2002

(iii)                If an event or circumstance which would otherwise constitute or give rise to a Force Majeure Event also constitutes an Illegality, it will be treated as an Illegality, except as described in clause (ii) above, and not a Force Majeure Event.
(d)                 _Deferral of Payments and Deliveries During Waiting Period._ If an Illegality or a Force Majeure Event has occurred and is continuing with respect to a Transaction, each payment or delivery which would otherwise be required to be made under that Transaction will be deferred to, and will not be due until:--
(i)                   the first Local Business Day or, in the case of a delivery, the first Local Delivery Day (or the first day that would have been a Local Business Day or Local Delivery Day, as appropriate, but for the occurrence of the event or circumstance constituting or giving rise to that Illegality or Force Majeure Event) following the end of any applicable Waiting Period in respect of that Illegality or Force Majeure Event, as the case may be; or
(ii)                 if earlier, the date on which the event or circumstance constituting or giving rise to that Illegality or Force Majeure Event ceases to exist or, if such date is not a Local Business Day or, in the case of a delivery, a Local Delivery Day, the first following day that is a Local Business Day or Local Delivery Day, as appropriate.
(e)                 _Inability of Head or Home Office to Perform Obligations of Branch._ If (i) an Illegality or a Force Majeure Event occurs under Section 5(b)(i)(1) or 5(b)(ii)(1) and the relevant Office is not the Affected Party's head or home office, (ii) Section 10(a) applies, (iii) the other party seeks performance of the relevant obligation or compliance with the relevant provision by the Affected Party's head or home office and (iv) the Affected Party's head or home office fails so to perform or comply due to the occurrence of an event or circumstance which would, if that head or home office were the Office through which the Affected Party makes and receives payments and deliveries with respect to the relevant Transaction, constitute or give rise to an Illegality or a Force Majeure Event, and such failure would otherwise constitute an Event of Default under Section 5(a)(i) or 5(a)(iii)(1) with respect to such party, then, for so long as the relevant event or circumstance continues to exist with respect to both the Office referred to in Section 5(b)(i)(1) or 5(b)(ii)(1), as the case may be, and the Affected Party's head or home office, such failure will not constitute an Event of Default under Section 5(a)(i) or 5(a)(iii)(1).
6.                   Early Termination; Close-Out Netting
(a)                 Right to Terminate Following Event of Default. If at any time an Event of Default with respect to a party (the "Defaulting Party") has occurred and is then continuing, the other party (the "Non-defaulting Party") may, by not more than 20 days notice to the Defaulting Party specifying the relevant Event of Default, designate a day not earlier than the day such notice is effective as an Early Termination Date in respect of all outstanding Transactions. If, however, "Automatic Early Termination" is specified in the Schedule as applying to a party, then an Early Termination Date in respect of all outstanding Transactions will occur immediately upon the occurrence with respect to such party of an Event of Default specified in Section 5(a)(vii)(1), (3), (5), (6) or, to the extent analogous thereto, (8), and as of the time immediately preceding the institution of the relevant proceeding or the presentation of the relevant petition upon the occurrence with respect to such party of an Event of Default specified in Section 5(a)(vii)(4) or, to the extent analogous thereto, (8).
(b)                 Right to Terminate Following Termination Event.
(i)                   Notice . If a Termination Event other than a Force Majeure Event occurs, an Affected Party will, promptly upon becoming aware of it, notify the other party, specifying the nature of that Termination Event and each Affected Transaction, and will also give the other party such other information about that Termination Event as the other party may reasonably require. If a Force Majeure Event occurs, each party will, promptly upon becoming aware of it, use all reasonable efforts to notify the other party, specifying the nature of that Force Majeure Event, and will also give the other party such other information about that Force Majeure Event as the other party may reasonably require.

(ii)                 Transfer to Avoid Termination Event. If a Tax Event occurs and there is only one Affected Party, or if a Tax Event Upon Merger occurs and the Burdened Party is the Affected Party, the Affected Party will, as a condition to its right to designate an Early Termination Date under Section 6(b)(iv), use all reasonable efforts (which will not require such party to incur a loss, other than immaterial, incidental expenses) to transfer within 20 days after it gives notice under Section 6(b)(i) all its rights and obligations under this Agreement in respect of the Affected Transactions to another of its Offices or Affiliates so that such Termination Event ceases to exist.
If the Affected Party is not able to make such a transfer it will give notice to the other party to that effect within such 20 day period, whereupon the other party may effect such a transfer within 30 days after the notice is given under Section 6(b)(i).
Any such transfer by a party under this Section 6(b)(ii) will be subject to and conditional upon the prior written consent of the other party, which consent will not be withheld if such other party's policies in effect at such time would permit it to enter into transactions with the transferee on the terms proposed.
(iii)                Two Affected Parties. If a Tax Event occurs and there are two Affected Parties, each party will use all reasonable efforts to reach agreement within 30 days after notice of such occurrence is given under Section 6(b)(i) to avoid that Termination Event.
(iv)               Right to Terminate.
(1)                 If:--
(A)                a transfer under Section 6(b)(ii) or an agreement under Section 6(b)(iii), as the case may be, has not been effected with respect to all Affected Transactions within 30 days after an Affected Party gives notice under Section 6(b)(i); or
(B)                a Credit Event Upon Merger or an Additional Termination Event occurs, or a Tax Event Upon Merger occurs and the Burdened Party is not the Affected Party,
the Burdened Party in the case of a Tax Event Upon Merger, any Affected Party in the case of a Tax Event or an Additional Termination Event if there are two Affected Parties, or the Non-affected Party in the case of a Credit Event Upon Merger or an Additional Termination Event if there is only one Affected Party may, if the relevant Termination Event is then continuing, by not more than 20 days notice to the other party, designate a day not earlier than the day such notice is effective as an Early Termination Date in respect of all Affected Transactions.
(2)                 If at any time an Illegality or a Force Majeure Event has occurred and is then continuing and any applicable Waiting Period has expired:--
(A)                Subject to clause (B) below, either party may, by not more than 20 days notice to the other party, designate (I) a day not earlier than the day on which such notice becomes effective as an Early Termination Date in respect of all Affected Transactions or (II) by specifying in that notice the Affected Transactions in respect of which it is designating the relevant day as an Early Termination Date, a day not earlier than two Local Business Days following the day on which such notice becomes effective as an Early Termination Date in respect of less than all Affected Transactions. Upon receipt of a notice designating an Early Termination Date in respect of less than all Affected Transactions, the other party may, by notice to the designating party, if such notice is effective on or before the day so designated, designate that same day as an Early Termination Date in respect of any or all other Affected Transactions.
(B)                An Affected Party (if the Illegality or Force Majeure Event relates to performance by such party or any Credit Support Provider of such party of an obligation to make any payment or delivery under, or to compliance with any other material provision of, the relevant Credit Support Document) will only have the right to designate an Early Termination Date under Section 6(b)(iv)(2)(A) as a result of an Illegality under Section 5(b)(i)(2) or a Force Majeure Event under Section 5(b)(ii)(2) following the prior designation by the other party of an Early Termination Date, pursuant to Section 6(b)(iv)(2)(A), in respect of less than all Affected Transactions.

(c)                 Effect of Designation.
(i)                   If notice designating an Early Termination Date is given under Section 6(a) or 6(b), the Early Termination Date will occur on the date so designated, whether or not the relevant Event of Default or Termination Event is then continuing.
(ii)                 Upon the occurrence or effective designation of an Early Termination Date, no further payments or deliveries under Section 2(a)(i) or 9(h)(i) in respect of the Terminated Transactions will be required to be made, but without prejudice to the other provisions of this Agreement. The amount, if any, payable in respect of an Early Termination Date will be determined pursuant to Sections 6(e) and 9(h)(ii).
(d)                 Calculations; Payment Date.
(i)                   Statement. On or as soon as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of an Early Termination Date, each party will make the calculations on its part, if any, contemplated by Section 6(e) and will provide to the other party a statement (1) showing, in reasonable detail, such calculations (including any quotations, market data or information from internal sources used in making such calculations), specifying (except where there are two Affected Parties) any Early Termination Amount payable and giving details of the relevant account to which any amount payable to it is to be paid. In the absence of written confirmation from the source of a quotation or market data obtained in determining a Close-out Amount, the records of the party obtaining such quotation or market data will be conclusive evidence of the existence and accuracy of such quotation or market data.
(ii)                 Payment Date. An Early Termination Amount due in respect of any Early Termination Date will, together with any amount of interest payable pursuant to Section 9(h)(ii)(2), be payable (1) on the day on which notice of the amount payable is effective in the case of an Early Termination Date which is designated or occurs as a result of an Event of Default and (2) on the day which is two Local Business Days after the day on which notice of the amount payable is effective (or, if there are two Affected Parties, after the day on which the statement provided pursuant to clause (i) above by the second party to provide such a statement is effective) in the case of an Early Termination Date which is designated as a result of a Termination Event.
(e)                 Payments on Early Termination. If an Early Termination Date occurs, the amount, if any, payable in respect of that Early Termination Date (the "Early Termination Amount") will be determined pursuant to this Section 6(e) and will be subject to Section 6(f).
(i)                   Events of Default. If the Early Termination Date results from an Event of Default, the Early Termination Amount will be an amount equal to (1) the sum of (A) the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Close-out Amount or Close-out Amounts (whether positive or negative) determined by the Non-defaulting Party for each Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions, as the case may be, and (B) the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to the Non-defaulting Party less (2) the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to the Defaulting Party. If the Early Termination Amount is a positive number, the Defaulting Party will pay it to the Non-defaulting Party; if it is a negative number, the Non-defaulting Party will pay the absolute value of the Early Termination Amount to the Defaulting Party.
(ii)                 Termination Events. If the Early Termination Date results from a Termination Event:--
(1)                 One Affected Party. Subject to clause (3) below, if there is one Affected Party, the Early Termination Amount will be determined in accordance with Section 6(e)(i), except that references to the Defaulting Party and to the Non-defaulting Party will be deemed to be references to the Affected Party and to the Non-affected Party, respectively.
ISDA Ò2002
12
(2)                 Two Affected Parties. Subject to clause (3) below, if there are two Affected Parties, each party will determine an amount equal to the Termination Currency Equivalent of the sum of the Close-out Amount or Close-out Amounts (whether positive or negative) for each Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions, as the case may be, and the Early Termination Amount will be an amount equal to (A) the sum of (I) one- half of the difference between the higher amount so determined (by party "X") and the lower amount so determined (by party "Y") and (II) the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to X less (B) the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to Y. If the Early Termination Amount is a positive number, Y will pay it to X; if it is a negative number, X will pay the absolute value of the Early Termination Amount to Y.
(3)                 Mid-Market Events. If that Termination Event is an Illegality or a Force Majeure Event, then the Early Termination Amount will be determined in accordance with clause (1) or (2) above, as appropriate, except that, for the purpose of determining a Close-out Amount or Close-out Amounts, the Determining Party will:--
(A)                if obtaining quotations from one or more third parties (or from any of the Determining Party's Affiliates), ask each third party or Affiliate (I) not to take account of the current creditworthiness of  the Determining Party or any existing Credit Support Document and (II) to provide mid-market quotations; and
(B)                in any other case, use mid-market values without regard to the creditworthiness of the Determining Party.
(iii)                Adjustment for Bankruptc y. In circumstances where an Early Termination Date occurs because Automatic Early Termination applies in respect of a party, the Early Termination Amount will be subject to such adjustments as are appropriate and permitted by applicable law to reflect any payments or deliveries made by one party to the other under this Agreement (and retained by such other party) during the period from the relevant Early Termination Date to the date for payment determined under Section 6(d)(ii).
(iv)               Adjustment for Illegality or Force Majeure Event. The failure by a party or any Credit Support Provider of such party to pay, when due, any Early Termination Amount will not constitute an Event of Default under Section 5(a)(i) or 5(a)(iii)(1) if such failure is due to the occurrence of an event or circumstance which would, if it occurred with respect to payment, delivery or compliance related to a Transaction, constitute or give rise to an Illegality or a Force Majeure Event. Such amount will (1) accrue interest and otherwise be treated as an Unpaid Amount owing to the other party if subsequently an Early Termination Date results from an Event of Default, a Credit Event Upon Merger or an Additional Termination Event in respect of which all outstanding Transactions are Affected Transactions and (2) otherwise accrue interest in accordance with Section 9(h)(ii)(2).
(v)                 Pre-Estimate. The parties agree that an amount recoverable under this Section 6(e) is a reasonable pre-estimate of loss and not a penalty. Such amount is payable for the loss of bargain and the loss of protection against future risks, and, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, neither party will be entitled to recover any additional damages as a consequence of the termination of the Terminated Transactions.
(f)                  Set-Off. Any Early Termination Amount payable to one party (the "Payee") by the other party (the "Payer"), in circumstances where there is a Defaulting Party or where there is one Affected Party in the case where either a Credit Event Upon Merger has occurred or any other Termination Event in respect of which all outstanding Transactions are Affected Transactions has occurred, will, at the option of the Non-defaulting Party or the Non-affected Party, as the case may be ("X") (and without prior notice to the Defaulting Party or the Affected Party, as the case may be), be reduced by its set-off against any other amounts ("Other Amounts") payable by the Payee to the Payer (whether or not arising under this Agreement, matured or contingent and irrespective of the currency, place of payment or place of booking of the obligation). To the extent that any Other Amounts are so set off, those Other Amounts will be discharged promptly and in all respects. X will give notice to the other party of any set-off effected under this Section 6(f).
ISDA Ò2002
13
For this purpose, either the Early Termination Amount or the Other Amounts (or the relevant portion of such amounts) may be converted by X into the currency in which the other is denominated at the rate of exchange at which such party would be able, in good faith and using commercially reasonable procedures, to purchase the relevant amount of such currency.
If an obligation is unascertained, X may in good faith estimate that obligation and set off in respect of the estimate, subject to the relevant party accounting to the other when the obligation is ascertained.
Nothing in this Section 6(f) will be effective to create a charge or other security interest. This Section 6(f) will be without prejudice and in addition to any right of set-off, offset, combination of accounts, lien, right of retention or withholding or similar right or requirement to which any party is at any time otherwise entitled or subject (whether by operation of law, contract or otherwise).
7.                   Transfer
Subject to Section 6(b)(ii) and to the extent permitted by applicable law, neither this Agreement nor any interest or obligation in or under this Agreement may be transferred (whether by way of security or otherwise) by either party without the prior written consent of the other party, except that:--
(a)                 a party may make such a transfer of this Agreement pursuant to a consolidation or amalgamation with, or merger with or into, or transfer of all or substantially all its assets to, another entity (but without prejudice to any other right or remedy under this Agreement); and
(b)                 a party may make such a transfer of all or any part of its interest in any Early Termination Amount payable to it by a Defaulting Party, together with any amounts payable on or with respect to that interest and any other rights associated with that interest pursuant to Sections 8, 9(h) and 11.
Any purported transfer that is not in compliance with this Section 7 will be void.
8.                   Contractual Currency
(a)                 Payment in the Contractual Currency. Each payment under this Agreement will be made in the relevant currency specified in this Agreement for that payment (the "Contractual Currency"). To the extent permitted by applicable law, any obligation to make payments under this Agreement in the Contractual Currency will not be discharged or satisfied by any tender in any currency other than the Contractual Currency, except to the extent such tender results in the actual receipt by the party to which payment is owed, acting in good faith and using commercially reasonable procedures in converting the currency so tendered into the Contractual Currency, of the full amount in the Contractual Currency of all amounts payable in respect of this Agreement. If for any reason the amount in the Contractual Currency so received falls short of the amount in the Contractual Currency payable in respect of this Agreement, the party required to make the payment will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, immediately pay such additional amount in the Contractual Currency as may be necessary to compensate for the shortfall.
If for any reason the amount in the Contractual Currency so received exceeds the amount in the Contractual Currency payable in respect of this Agreement, the party receiving the payment will refund promptly the amount of such excess.
(b)                 Judgments. To the extent permitted by applicable law, if any judgment or order expressed in a currency other than the Contractual Currency is rendered (i) for the payment of any amount owing in respect of this Agreement, (ii) for the payment of any amount relating to any early termination in respect of this Agreement or (iii) in respect of a judgment or order of another court for the payment of any amount described in clause (i) or (ii) above, the party seeking recovery, after recovery in full of the aggregate amount to which such party is entitled pursuant to the judgment or order, will be entitled to receive immediately from the other party the amount of any shortfall of the Contractual Currency received by such party as a consequence of sums paid in such other currency and will refund promptly to the other party any excess of the Contractual Currency received by such party as a consequence of sums paid in such other currency if such shortfall or such excess arises or results from any variation between the rate of exchange at which the Contractual Currency is converted into the currency of the judgment or order for the purpose of such judgment or order and the rate of exchange at which such party is able, acting in good faith and using commercially reasonable procedures in converting the currency received into the Contractual Currency, to purchase the Contractual Currency with the amount of the currency of the judgment or order actually received by such party.

(c)                 Separate Indemnities. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the indemnities in this Section 8 constitute separate and independent obligations from the other obligations in this Agreement, will be enforceable as separate and independent causes of action, will apply notwithstanding any indulgence granted by the party to which any payment is owed and will not be affected by judgment being obtained or claim or proof being made for any other sums payable in respect of this Agreement.
(d)                 Evidence of Loss. For the purpose of this Section 8, it will be sufficient for a party to demonstrate that it would have suffered a loss had an actual exchange or purchase been made.
9.                   Miscellaneous
(a)                 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding of the parties with respect to its subject matter. Each of the parties acknowledges that in entering into this Agreement it has not relied on any oral or written representation, warranty or other assurance (except as provided for or referred to in this Agreement) and waives all rights and remedies which might otherwise be available to it in respect thereof, except that nothing in this Agreement will limit or exclude any liability of a party for fraud.
(b)                 Amendments. An amendment, modification or waiver in respect of this Agreement will only be effective if in writing (including a writing evidenced by a facsimile transmission) and executed by each of the parties or confirmed by an exchange of telexes or by an exchange of electronic messages on an electronic messaging system.
(c)                 Survival of Obligations. Without prejudice to Sections 2(a)(iii) and 6(c)(ii), the obligations of the parties under this Agreement will survive the termination of any Transaction.
(d)                 Remedies Cumulative. Except as provided in this Agreement, the rights, powers, remedies and privileges provided in this Agreement are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, powers, remedies and privileges provided by law.
(e)                 Counterparts and Confirmations.
(i)                   This Agreement (and each amendment, modification and waiver in respect of it) may be executed and delivered in counterparts (including by facsimile transmission and by electronic messaging system), each of which will be deemed an original.
(ii)                 The parties intend that they are legally bound by the terms of each Transaction from the moment they agree to those terms (whether orally or otherwise). A Confirmation will be entered into as soon as practicable and may be executed and delivered in counterparts (including by facsimile transmission) or be created by an exchange of telexes, by an exchange of electronic messages on an electronic messaging system or by an exchange of e-mails, which in each case will be sufficient for all purposes to evidence a binding supplement to this Agreement. The parties will specify therein or through another effective means that any such counterpart, telex, electronic message or e-mail constitutes a Confirmation.
(f)                  No Waiver of Rights. A failure or delay in exercising any right, power or privilege in respect of this Agreement will not be presumed to operate as a waiver, and a single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege will not be presumed to preclude any subsequent or further exercise, of that right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.
(g)                 Headings. The headings used in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and are not to affect the construction of or to be taken into consideration in interpreting this Agreement.

(h)                 Interest and Compensation.
(i)                   Prior to Early Termination. Prior to the occurrence or effective designation of an Early Termination Date in respect of the relevant Transaction:--
(1)                 Interest on Defaulted Payments. If a party defaults in the performance of any payment obligation, it will, to the extent permitted by applicable law and subject to Section 6(c), pay interest (before as well as after judgment) on the overdue amount to the other party on demand in the same currency as the overdue amount, for the period from (and including) the original due date for payment to (but excluding) the date of actual payment (and excluding any period in respect of which interest or compensation in respect of the overdue amount is due pursuant to clause (3)(B) or (C) below), at the Default Rate.
(2)                 Compensation for Defaulted Deliveries. If a party defaults in the performance of any obligation required to be settled by delivery, it will on demand (A) compensate the other party to the extent provided for in the relevant Confirmation or elsewhere in this Agreement and
(B) unless otherwise provided in the relevant Confirmation or elsewhere in this Agreement, to the extent permitted by applicable law and subject to Section 6(c), pay to the other party interest (before as well as after judgment) on an amount equal to the fair market value of that which was required to be delivered in the same currency as that amount, for the period from (and including) the originally scheduled date for delivery to (but excluding) the date of actual delivery (and excluding any period in respect of which interest or compensation in respect of that amount is due pursuant to clause (4) below), at the Default Rate. The fair market value of any obligation referred to above will be determined as of the originally scheduled date for delivery, in good faith and using commercially reasonable procedures, by the party that was entitled to take delivery.

laws, and the European Securities and Markets Authority and national regulators in the E.U. under the E.U. Regulation No. 648/2012 on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories in the case of trade reporting under applicable E.U. laws) and that such disclosures could result in certain anonymous swap transaction and pricing data becoming available to the public. Each party further acknowledges that, for purposes of complying with regulatory reporting obligations, a party may use a third party service provider to transfer trade information into a TR and that a TR may engage the services of a global trade repository regulated by one or more governmental regulators. Each party also acknowledges that disclosures made pursuant hereto may be made to recipients in a jurisdiction other than that of the disclosing party or a jurisdiction that may not necessarily provide an equivalent or adequate level of protection for personal data as the counterparty's home jurisdiction. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) to the extent that applicable non-disclosure, confidentiality, bank secrecy, data privacy or other law imposes non-disclosure requirements on transaction and similar information required or permitted to be disclosed as contemplated herein but permits a party to waive such requirements by consent, the consent and acknowledgements provided herein shall be a consent by each party for purposes of such law; (ii) any agreement between the parties to maintain confidentiality of information contained in this Agreement or in any non- disclosure, confidentiality or other agreement shall continue to apply to the extent that such agreement is not inconsistent with the disclosure of information in connection with the Reporting Requirements as set out herein; and (iii) nothing herein is intended to limit the scope of any other consent to disclosure separately given by each party to the other party.
14
(n)	 Incorporation of the terms of the IBOR Fallbacks Protocol.
(a)	 From and including 25 January 2021, the terms of the Attachment to the ISDA 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol published by ISDA on 23 October 2020 (IBOR Fallbacks Protocol) are incorporated into and apply to this Agreement. For the purposes of this Agreement the parties will each be deemed to be an 'Adhering Party' with respect to the IBOR Fallbacks Protocol as between themselves and references in the IBOR Fallbacks Protocol to a 'Protocol Covered Document' will be deemed to include references to this Agreement. If each of the parties subsequently becomes or is an Adhering Party to the IBOR Fallbacks Protocol by delivering an Adherence Letter to ISDA in accordance with the IBOR Fallbacks Protocol, to the extent that there is any inconsistency between this Part 5(p) and the IBOR Fallbacks Protocol, the this Part (p) shall prevail.
(b)	 Each party represents to the other party that the application of the terms of the IBOR Fallbacks Protocol and any amendment contemplated by the IBOR Fallbacks Protocol (including the Attachment thereto) will not, in and of itself, adversely affect the enforceability, effectiveness or validity of any obligations owed, whether by it or by any third party, under any Credit Support Document in respect of its obligations under this Transaction.
(c)	 Terms used in this Part 5(p) have the meaning given to those term in the IBOR Fallbacks Protocol unless another meaning is provided.
(o)	 Limited Recourse. Except as otherwise stated in the Agreement or this Schedule, any amounts owed or liabilities incurred by Party B in respect of any Transaction entered into under this Agreement may be satisfied solely from the assets of Party B. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and except as otherwise stated above, in no event shall Party A have recourse under this Agreement, whether by set-off or otherwise, with respect to any such amounts owed or liabilities incurred to or against (i) any assets of any person or entity (including, without limitation, any person or entity whose account is under the management of the General Partner) other than Party B, (ii) any assets of any affiliate of Party B, or (iii) any assets of the General Partner or any affiliate of such General Partner.
15
(p)	 Condition End Date. Section 2 of the Agreement is amended to add at the end a new Section 2(e), reading in its entirety as follows:
"(e) Condition End Date.
(i) If an Event of Default occurs, the Defaulting Party may, by notice to the Non-defaulting Party identifying the Event of Default and confirming its occurrence, specify that clause (iii) will apply to that Event of Default.
(ii) If a Potential Event of Default occurs with respect to a party, that party may, by notice to the other party identifying the Potential Event of Default and confirming its occurrence:
(A)  waive any requirement that notice be given or that any period of time elapse, by virtue of which waiver the Potential Event of Default will become an Event of Default; and
(B)  specify that clause (iii) will apply to that Event of Default.
(iii) If this clause (iii) applies to an Event of Default, then the condition precedent specified in Section 2(a)(iii)(1) with respect to that Event of Default will cease to be a condition precedent to each obligation of the Non- defaulting Party on the relevant Condition End Date. Any obligation that would have been payable or deliverable by the Non-defaulting Party but for Section 2(a)(iii)(1) will become payable or deliverable on the first Local Business Day falling after the Condition End Date (together with interest payable on demand in accordance with Section 9(h)(i)(3)(A) or compensation and interest payable on demand in accordance with Section 9(h)(i)(4)(A), as the case may be).
(iv) Subject to clause (v) below, if, after a party has given a notice under clause (i) or (ii) above with respect to an Event of Default or Potential Event of Default, another Event of Default or Potential Event of Default occurs with respect to that party, then, with respect to the earlier Event of Default, no Condition End Date will occur and therefore clause (iii) will not apply. This will not affect the right of that party to give a notice under clause (i) in respect of the subsequent Event of Default or under clause (ii) in respect of the subsequent Potential Event of Default. This clause (iv) is without prejudice to the right of the Defaulting Party to give a new notice to the Non-defaulting Party under clause (i) with respect to the earlier Event of Default.
(v) If the Defaulting Party has given a notice under clause (i) above in respect of an Event of Default under Section 5(a)(vii), then clause (iv) will not apply."
Section 14 of the Agreement is amended to add in the appropriate alphabetical position a new definition of "Condition End Date", reading in its entirety as follows:
"" Condition End Date" means, with respect to an Event of Default, the day falling 90 days after a notice given by the Defaulting Party under Section 2(e)(i) or Section 2(e)(ii) is effective if the Event of Default is still continuing on that day."

Accordingly, the parties agree as follows:--
Paragraph 1.           Interpretation
(a)                 Definitions and Inconsistency. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein or elsewhere in this Agreement have the meanings specified pursuant to Paragraph 12, and all references in this Annex to Paragraphs are to Paragraphs of this Annex. In the event of any inconsistency between this Annex and the other provisions of this Schedule, this Annex will prevail, and in the event of any inconsistency between Paragraph 13 and the other provisions of this Annex, Paragraph 13 will prevail.
(b)                 Secured Party and Pledgor. All references in this Annex to the "Secured Party" will be to either party when acting in that capacity and all corresponding references to the "Pledgor" will be to the other party when acting in that capacity; provided , however , that if Other Posted Support (VM) is held by a party to this Annex, all references herein to that party as the Secured Party with respect to that Other Posted Support (VM) will be to that party as the beneficiary thereof and will not subject that support or that party as the beneficiary thereof to provisions of law generally relating to security interests and secured parties.
(c)                 Scope of this Annex and the Other CSA. The only Transactions which will be relevant for the purposes of determining "Exposure" under this Annex will be the Covered Transactions specified in Paragraph 13.

exceeds
(ii)                  the Secured Party's Exposure.
Paragraph 4.           Conditions Precedent, Transfer Timing, Calculations and Substitutions
(a)                 Conditions Precedent. Unless otherwise specified in Paragraph 13, each Transfer obligation of the Pledgor under Paragraphs 3, 5 and 6(d) and of the Secured Party under Paragraphs 3, 4(d)(ii), 5, 6(d) and 11(h) is subject to the conditions precedent that:
(i)                   no Event of Default, Potential Event of Default or Specified Condition has occurred and is continuing with respect to the other party; and

Page 2 of 21
(c)                 Calculations. All calculations of Value and Exposure for purposes of Paragraphs 3 and 6(d) will be made by the Valuation Agent as of the Valuation Time; provided that the Valuation Agent may use, in the case of any calculation of (i) Value, Values most recently reasonably available for close of business in the relevant market for the relevant Eligible Credit Support (VM) as of the Valuation Time and (ii) Exposure, relevant information or data most recently reasonably available for close of business in the relevant market(s) as of the Valuation Time. The Valuation Agent will notify each party (or the other party, if the Valuation Agent is a party) of its calculations not later than the Notification Time on the Local Business Day following the applicable Valuation Date (or in the case of Paragraph 6(d), following the date of calculation).
(d)                 Substitutions.

Paragraph 5.           Dispute Resolution
If a party (a "Disputing Party ") disputes (I) the Valuation Agent's calculation of a Delivery Amount (VM) or a Return Amount (VM) or (II) the Value of any Transfer of Eligible Credit Support (VM) or Posted Credit Support (VM), then:
(i)                   the Disputing Party will notify the other party and the Valuation Agent (if the Valuation Agent is not the other party) not later than the close of business on (X) the date that the Transfer is due in respect of such Delivery Amount (VM) or Return Amount (VM) in the case of (I) above, or
(Y) the Local Business Day following the date of Transfer in the case of (II) above,
(ii)                 subject to Paragraph 4(a), the appropriate party will Transfer the undisputed amount to the other party not later than the close of business on (X) the date that the Transfer is due in respect of such Delivery Amount (VM) or Return Amount (VM) in the case of (I) above, or (Y) the Local Business Day following the date of Transfer in the case of (II) above,
(iii)                the parties will consult with each other in an attempt to resolve the dispute, and
(iv)               if they fail to resolve the dispute by the Resolution Time, then:
(A)                In the case of a dispute involving a Delivery Amount (VM) or Return Amount (VM), unless otherwise specified in Paragraph 13, the Valuation Agent will recalculate the Exposure and the Value as of the Recalculation Date by:
(1)                 utilizing any calculations of Exposure for the Covered Transactions that the parties have agreed are not in dispute;
(2)                 (I) if this Agreement is a 1992 ISDA Master Agreement, calculating the Exposure for the Covered Transactions in dispute by seeking four actual quotations at mid-market from Reference Market-makers for purposes of calculating Market Quotation, and taking the arithmetic average of those obtained, or (II) if this Agreement is an ISDA 2002 Master Agreement or a 1992 ISDA Master Agreement in which the definition of Loss and/or Market Quotation has been amended (including where such amendment has occurred pursuant to the terms of a separate agreement or protocol) to reflect the definition of Close- out Amount from the pre-printed form of the ISDA 2002 Master Agreement as published by ISDA, calculating the Exposure for the Covered Transactions in dispute by seeking four actual quotations at mid-market from third parties for purposes of calculating the relevant Close-out Amount, and taking the arithmetic average of those obtained; provided that, in either case, if four quotations are not available for a particular Covered Transaction, then fewer than four quotations may be used for that Covered Transaction, and if no quotations are available for a particular Covered Transaction, then the Valuation Agent's original calculations will be used for that Covered Transaction; and
Page 3 of 21
(3)                 utilizing the procedures specified in Paragraph 13 for calculating the Value, if disputed, of Posted Credit Support (VM).
(B)                In the case of a dispute involving the Value of any Transfer of Eligible Credit Support (VM) or Posted Credit Support (VM), the Valuation Agent will recalculate the Value as of the date of Transfer pursuant to Paragraph 13.
Following a recalculation pursuant to this Paragraph, the Valuation Agent will notify each party (or the other party, if the Valuation Agent is a party) not later than the Notification Time on the Local Business Day following the Resolution Time. The appropriate party will, upon demand following that notice by the Valuation Agent or a resolution pursuant to (iii) above and subject to Paragraphs 4(a) and 4(b), make the appropriate Transfer.
Paragraph 6.           Holding and Using Posted Collateral (VM)
(a)                 Care of Posted Collateral (VM). Without limiting the Secured Party's rights under Paragraph 6(c), the Secured Party will exercise reasonable care to assure the safe custody of all Posted Collateral (VM) to the extent required by applicable law, and in any event the Secured Party will be deemed to have exercised reasonable care if it exercises at least the same degree of care as it would exercise with respect to its own property. Except as specified in the preceding sentence, the Secured Party will have no duty with respect to Posted Collateral (VM), including, without limitation, any duty to collect any Distributions, or enforce or preserve any rights pertaining thereto.
(b)                 _Eligibility to Hold Posted Collateral (VM); Custodians (VM)._
(i)                   General. Subject to the satisfaction of any conditions specified in Paragraph 13 for holding Posted Collateral (VM), the Secured Party will be entitled to hold Posted Collateral (VM) or to appoint an agent (a "Custodian (VM) ") to hold Posted Collateral (VM) for the Secured Party. Upon notice by the Secured Party to the Pledgor of the appointment of a Custodian (VM), the Pledgor's obligations to make any Transfer will be discharged by making the Transfer to that Custodian (VM). The holding of Posted Collateral (VM) by a Custodian (VM) will be deemed to be the holding of that Posted Collateral (VM) by the Secured Party for which the Custodian (VM) is acting.
(ii)                 Failure to Satisfy Conditions. If the Secured Party or its Custodian (VM) fails to satisfy any conditions for holding Posted Collateral (VM), then upon a demand made by the Pledgor, the Secured Party will, not later than five Local Business Days after the demand, Transfer or cause its Custodian (VM) to Transfer all Posted Collateral (VM) held by it to a Custodian (VM) that satisfies those conditions or to the Secured Party if it satisfies those conditions.
(iii)                Liability. The Secured Party will be liable for the acts or omissions of its Custodian (VM) to the same extent that the Secured Party would be liable hereunder for its own acts or omissions.
(c)                 Use of Posted Collateral (VM). Unless otherwise specified in Paragraph 13 and without limiting the rights and obligations of the parties under Paragraphs 3, 4(d)(ii), 5, 6(d) and 8, if the Secured Party is not a Defaulting Party or an Affected Party with respect to a Specified Condition and no Early Termination Date has occurred or been designated as the result of an Event of Default or Specified Condition with respect to the Secured Party, then the Secured Party will, notwithstanding Section 9-207 of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, have the right to:
(i)                   sell, pledge, rehypothecate, assign, invest, use, commingle or otherwise dispose of, or otherwise use in its business any Posted Collateral (VM) it holds, free from any claim or right of any nature whatsoever of the Pledgor, including any equity or right of redemption by the Pledgor; and
Page 4 of 21
(ii)                 register any Posted Collateral (VM) in the name of the Secured Party, its Custodian (VM) or a nominee for either.
For purposes of the obligation to Transfer Eligible Credit Support (VM) or Posted Credit Support (VM) pursuant to Paragraphs 3 and 5 and any rights or remedies authorized under this Agreement, the Secured Party will be deemed to continue to hold all Posted Collateral (VM) and to receive Distributions made thereon, regardless of whether the Secured Party has exercised any rights with respect to any Posted Collateral (VM) pursuant to (i) or (ii) above.
(d)                 _Distributions, Interest Amount (VM) and Interest Payment (VM)._
(i)                   Distributions. Subject to Paragraph 4(a), if the Secured Party receives or is deemed to receive Distributions on a Local Business Day, it will Transfer to the Pledgor not later than the following Local Business Day any Distributions it receives or is deemed to receive to the extent that a Delivery Amount (VM) would not be created or increased by that Transfer, as calculated by the Valuation Agent (and the date of calculation will be deemed to be a Valuation Date for this purpose).
(ii)                 Interest Amount (VM) and Interest Payment (VM).
Unless otherwise specified in Paragraph 13 and subject to Paragraph 4(a), in lieu of any interest, dividends or other amounts paid or deemed to have been paid with respect to Posted Collateral (VM) in the form of Cash (all of which may be retained by the Secured Party),

(1)                 if the Interest Payer (VM) is entitled to demand a Delivery Amount (VM) or Return Amount (VM), in respect of the date such Interest Payment (VM) is required to be Transferred:
(a) such Delivery Amount (VM) or Return Amount (VM) will be reduced (but not below zero) by such Interest Payment (VM); provided that, in case of such Return Amount (VM), if the amount of Posted Collateral (VM) which is comprised of Cash in the Base Currency is less than such Interest Payment (VM), such reduction will only be to the extent of the amount of such Cash which is Posted Collateral (VM) (the "Eligible Return Amount (VM) "); and

(B)                if "Interest Adjustment" is specified as applicable in Paragraph 13, the Posted Collateral (VM) will be adjusted by the Secured Party, at the times specified in Paragraph 13, as follows:
(1)                 if the Interest Amount (VM) for an Interest Period is a positive number, the Interest Amount (VM) will constitute Posted Collateral (VM) in the form of Cash in the Base Currency and will be subject to the security interest granted under Paragraph 2; and
(2)                 if the Interest Amount (VM) for an Interest Period is a negative number and any Posted Collateral (VM) is in the form of Cash in the Base Currency, the Interest Amount (VM) will constitute a reduction of Posted Collateral (VM) in the form of such Cash in an amount (such amount, the "Interest Adjustment Reduction Amount (VM) ") equal to the absolute value of the Interest Amount (VM); provided that if the amount of Posted Collateral (VM) which is comprised of such Cash is less than the Interest Adjustment Reduction Amount (VM), such reduction will only be to the extent of the amount of such Cash which is Posted Collateral (VM) and the Pledgor will be obligated to Transfer the remainder of the Interest Adjustment Reduction Amount (VM) to the Secured Party on the day that such reduction occurred.

Each party represents to the other party (which representations will be deemed to be repeated as of each date on which it, as the Pledgor, Transfers Eligible Collateral (VM)) that:
(i)                   it has the power to grant a security interest in and lien on any Eligible Collateral (VM) it Transfers as the Pledgor and has taken all necessary actions to authorize the granting of that security interest and lien;

(iv)               the performance by it of its obligations under this Annex will not result in the creation of any security interest, lien or other encumbrance on any Posted Collateral (VM) other than the security interest and lien granted under Paragraph 2.

Paragraph 11.       Miscellaneous
(a)                 Default Interest. A Secured Party that fails to make, when due, any Transfer of Posted Collateral (VM) will be obligated to pay the Pledgor (to the extent permitted under applicable law) an amount equal to interest at the Default Rate multiplied by the Value of the items of property that were required to be Transferred, from (and including) the date that Posted Collateral (VM) was required to be Transferred to (but excluding) the date of Transfer of that Posted Collateral (VM). This interest will be calculated on the basis of daily compounding and the actual number of days elapsed. An Interest Payer (VM) that fails to make, when due, any Transfer of an Interest Payment (VM) will be obligated to pay the Interest Payee (VM) (to the extent permitted under applicable law) an amount equal to interest at the Default Rate (and for such purposes, if the Default Rate is less than zero, it will be deemed to be zero) multiplied by that Interest Payment (VM), from (and including) the date that Interest Payment (VM) was required to be Transferred to (but excluding) the date of Transfer of that Interest Payment (VM). This interest will be calculated on the basis of daily compounding and the actual number of days elapsed.
(b)                 Further Assurances. Promptly following a demand made by a party, the other party will execute, deliver, file and record any financing statement, specific assignment or other document and take any other action that may be necessary or desirable and reasonably requested by that party to create, preserve, perfect or validate any security interest or lien granted under Paragraph 2, to enable that party to exercise or enforce its rights under this Annex with respect to Posted Credit Support (VM) or an Interest Payment (VM) or to effect or document a release of a security interest on Posted Collateral (VM) or an Interest Payment (VM).

(d)                 Good Faith and Commercially Reasonable Manner.

(h)                 _Return of Posted Credit Support (VM) with a Value of Zero_. Subject to Paragraph 4(a), the Secured Party will, promptly upon demand (but in no event later than the time at which a Transfer would be due under Paragraph 4(b) with respect to a demand for the Transfer of Eligible Credit Support (VM) or Posted Credit Support (VM)), Transfer to the Pledgor any item of Posted Credit Support (VM) (or the specified amount of such item) that as of the date of such demand has a Value of zero; provided that the Secured Party will only be obligated to Transfer any Posted Credit Support (VM) in accordance with this Paragraph 11(h), if, as of the date of Transfer of such item, the Pledgor has satisfied all of its Transfer obligations under this Annex, if any.
(i)                   Reinstatement of Credit Support Eligibility. Upon a reasonable request by the Pledgor, the Secured Party will determine whether an item (or a specified amount of such item) of Eligible Credit Support (VM) that was the subject of a prior Legal Ineligibility Notice would currently satisfy the Legal Eligibility Requirements applicable to the Secured Party. If the Secured Party determines that as of such date of determination such item (or specified amount of such item) satisfies the Legal Eligibility Requirements applicable to the Secured Party, the Secured Party will promptly following such determination rescind the relevant Legal Ineligibility Notice with respect to such item (or specified amount of such item) by written notice to the Pledgor. Upon the delivery of such notice, the relevant item (or specified amount of such item) will constitute Eligible Credit Support (VM) hereunder.

then, on such date and in respect of each such Fungible Credit Support Type, each party's obligation to make a transfer of any such Fungible Credit Support Type hereunder or under such Other CSA will be automatically satisfied and discharged and, if the aggregate amount that would have otherwise been transferred by one party exceeds the aggregate amount that would have otherwise been transferred by the other party, replaced by an obligation hereunder or under such Other CSA, as applicable, upon the party by which the larger aggregate amount would have been transferred to transfer to the other party the excess of the larger aggregate amount over the smaller aggregate amount. If a party's obligation to make a transfer of credit support under this Annex or an Other CSA is automatically satisfied and discharged pursuant to this Paragraph 11(j), then, for purposes of this Annex or the Other CSA, as applicable, the other party will be deemed to have received credit support of the applicable Fungible Credit Support Type in the amount that would otherwise have been required to be transferred, in each case on the day on which the relevant transfer was due.
