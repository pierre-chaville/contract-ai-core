MASTER AGREEMENT
dated as of
…… 15 October 2015………….
Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited ABN 11 005 357 522 ( "Party A") 	   	 Perpetual Trustee Company Limited ABN 42 000 001 007 in its capacity as trustee of the SMART ABS Series 2015-1US Trust ( "Party B") Macquarie Securities Management Pty Limited ABN 26 003 435 443 (the "Manager")
have entered and/or anticipate entering into one or more transactions (each a "Transaction") that are or will be governed by this Master Agreement, which includes the schedule (the "Schedule"), and the documents and other confirming evidence (each a "Confirmation") exchanged between the parties confirming those Transactions.
Accordingly, the parties agree as follows: --
1. 	  Interpretation
(a)       Definitions. The terms defined in Section 14 and in the Schedule will have the meanings therein specified for the purpose of this Master Agreement.
(b)       Inconsistency.  In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of the Schedule and the other provisions of this Master Agreement, the Schedule will prevail. In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of any Confirmation and this Master Agreement (including the Schedule), such Confirmation will prevail for the purpose of the relevant Transaction.
(c)       Single Agreement.  All Transactions are entered into in reliance on the fact that this Master Agreement and all Confirmations form a single agreement between the parties (collectively referred to as this "Agreement"), and the parties would not otherwise enter into any Transactions.
2. 	  Obligations
(a)       General Conditions.
(i)      Each party will make each payment or delivery specified in each Confirmation to be made by it, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement.
(ii)     Payments under this Agreement will be made on the due date for value on that date in the place of the account specified in the relevant Confirmation or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement, in freely transferable funds and in the manner customary for payments in the required currency. Where settlement is by delivery (that is, other than by payment), such delivery will be made for receipt on the due date in the manner customary for the relevant obligation unless otherwise specified in the relevant Confirmation or elsewhere in this Agreement.
(iii)    Each obligation of each party under Section 2(a)(i) is subject to (1) the condition precedent that no Event of Default or Potential Event of Default with respect to the other party has occurred and is continuing, (2) the condition precedent that no Early Termination Date in respect of the relevant Transaction has occurred or been effectively designated and (3) each other applicable condition precedent specified in this Agreement.

(b)       Change of Account. Either party may change its account for receiving a payment or delivery by giving notice to the other party at least five Local Business Days prior to the scheduled date for the payment or delivery to which such change applies unless such other party gives timely notice of a reasonable objection to such change.
(c)       Netting. If on any date amounts would otherwise be payable:--
(i)     in the same currency; and
(ii)    in respect of the same Transaction,
by each party to the other, then, on such date, each party's obligation to make payment of any such amount will be automatically satisfied and discharged and, if the aggregate amount that would otherwise have been payable by one party exceeds the aggregate amount that would otherwise have been payable by the other party, replaced by an obligation upon the party by whom the larger aggregate amount would have been payable to pay to the other party the excess of the larger aggregate amount over the smaller aggregate amount.
The parties may elect in respect of two or more Transactions that a net amount will be determined in respect of all amounts payable on the same date in the same currency in respect of such Transactions, regardless of whether such amounts are payable in respect of the same Transaction. The election may be made in the Schedule or a Confirmation by specifying that subparagraph (ii) above will not apply to the Transactions identified as being subject to the election, together with the starting date (in which case subparagraph (ii) above will not, or will cease to, apply to such Transactions from such date).
This election may be made separately for different groups of Transactions and will apply separately to each pairing of Offices through which the parties make and receive payments or deliveries.
(d)      Deduction or Withholding for Tax.
(i)      Gross-Up. All payments under this Agreement will be made without any deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax unless such deduction or withholding is required by any applicable law, as modified by the practice of any relevant governmental revenue authority, then in effect. If a party is so required to deduct or withhold, then that party ("X") will:--
(1)    promptly notify the other party ("Y") of such requirement;
(2)    pay to the relevant authorities the full amount required to be deducted or withheld (including the full amount required to be deducted or withheld from any additional amount paid by X to Y under this Section 2(d)) promptly upon the earlier of determining that such deduction or withholding is required or receiving notice that such amount has been assessed against Y;
(3)    promptly forward to Y an official receipt (or a certified copy), or other documentation reasonably acceptable to Y, evidencing such payment to such authorities; and
(4)    if such Tax is an Indemnifiable Tax, pay to Y, in addition to the payment to which Y is otherwise entitled under this Agreement, such additional amount as is necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by Y (free and clear of Indemnifiable Taxes, whether assessed against X or Y) will equal the full amount Y would have received had no such deduction or withholding been required. However, X will not be required to pay any additional amount to Y to the extent that it would not be required to be paid but for:--
(A)   the failure by Y to comply with or perform any agreement contained in Section 4(a)(i), 4(a)(iii) or 4(d); or
(B)   the failure of a representation made by Y pursuant to Section 3(f) to be accurate and true unless such failure would not have occurred but for (I) any action taken by a taxing authority, or brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, on or after the date on which a Transaction is entered into (regardless of whether such action is taken or brought with respect to a party to this Agreement) or (II) a Change in Tax Law.
2 	    	 ISDA ®  1992
(ii)    Liability. If: --
(1)    X is required by any applicable law, as modified by the practice of any relevant governmental revenue authority, to make any deduction or withholding in respect of which X would not be required to pay an additional amount to Y under Section 2(d)(i)(4);
(2)    X does not so deduct or withhold; and
(3)    a liability resulting from such Tax is assessed directly against X,
then, except to the extent Y has satisfied or then satisfies the liability resulting from such Tax, Y will promptly pay to X the amount of such liability (including any related liability for interest, but including any related liability for penalties only if Y has failed to comply with or perform any agreement contained in Section 4(a)(i), 4(a)(iii) or 4(d)).
(e)       Default Interest; Other Amounts. Prior to the occurrence or effective designation of an Early Termination Date in respect of the relevant Transaction, a party that defaults in the performance of any payment obligation will, to the extent permitted by law and subject to Section 6(c), be required to pay interest (before as well as after judgment) on the overdue amount to the other party on demand in the same currency as such overdue amount, for the period from (and including) the original due date for payment to (but excluding) the date of actual payment, at the Default Rate. Such interest will be calculated on the basis of daily compounding and the actual number of days elapsed. If, prior to the occurrence or effective designation of an Early Termination Date in respect of the relevant Transaction, a party defaults in the performance of any obligation required to be settled by delivery, it will compensate the other party on demand if and to the extent provided for in the relevant Confirmation or elsewhere in this Agreement.
3.        Representations
Each party represents to the other party (which representations will be deemed to be repeated by each party on each date on which a Transaction is entered into and, in the case of the representations in Section 3(f), at all times until the termination of this Agreement) that:--
(a)       Basic Representations.
(i)      Status. It is duly organised and validly existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organisation or incorporation and, if relevant under such laws, in good standing;
(ii)    Powers.  It has the power to execute this Agreement and any other documentation relating to this Agreement to which it is a party, to deliver this Agreement and any other documentation relating to this Agreement that it is required by this Agreement to deliver and to perform its obligations under this Agreement and any obligations it has under any Credit Support Document to which it is a party and has taken all necessary action to authorise such execution, delivery and performance;
(iii)   No Violation or Conflict. Such execution, delivery and performance do not violate or conflict with any law applicable to it, any provision of its constitutional documents, any order or judgment of any court or other agency of government applicable to it or any of its assets or any contractual restriction binding on or affecting it or any of its assets;
(iv)   Consents. All governmental and other consents that are required to have been obtained by it with respect to this Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which it is a party have been obtained and are in full force and effect and all conditions of any such consents have been complied with; and
(v)    Obligations Binding. Its obligations under this Agreement and any Credit Support Document to which it is a party constitute its legal, valid and binding obligations, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, reorganisation, insolvency, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and subject, as to enforceability, to equitable principles of general application (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law)).
3 	    	 ISDA ®  1992
(b)       Absence of Certain Events. No Event of Default or Potential Event of Default or, to its knowledge, Termination Event with respect to it has occurred and is continuing and no such event or circumstance would occur as a result of its entering into or performing its obligations under this Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which it is a party.
(c)       Absence of Litigation. There is not pending or, to its knowledge, threatened against it or any of its Affiliates any action, suit or proceeding at law or in equity or before any court, tribunal, governmental body, agency or official or any arbitrator that is likely to affect the legality, validity or enforceability against it of this Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which it is a party or its ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement or such Credit Support Document.
(d)       Accuracy of Specified Information. All applicable information that is furnished in writing by or on behalf of it to the other party and is identified for the purpose of this Section 3(d) in the Schedule is, as of the date of the information, true, accurate and complete in every material respect.

4. 	  Agreements
Each party agrees with the other that, so long as either party has or may have any obligation under this Agreement or under any Credit Support Document to which it is a party:--
(a)       Furnish Specified Information. It will deliver to the other party or, in certain cases under subparagraph (iii) below, to such government or taxing authority as the other party reasonably directs:--
(i)      any forms, documents or certificates relating to taxation specified in the Schedule or any Confirmation;
(ii)     any other documents specified in the Schedule or any Confirmation; and
(iii)    upon reasonable demand by such other party, any form or document that may be required or reasonably requested in writing in order to allow such other party or its Credit Support Provider to make a payment under this Agreement or any applicable Credit Support Document without any deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax or with such deduction or withholding at a reduced rate (so long as the completion, execution or submission of such form or document would not materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of the party in receipt of such demand), with any such form or document to be accurate and completed in a manner reasonably satisfactory to such other party and to be executed and to be delivered with any reasonably required certification,
in each case by the date specified in the Schedule or such Confirmation or, if none is specified, as soon as reasonably practicable.
(b)       Maintain Authorisations. It will use all reasonable efforts to maintain in full force and effect all consents of any governmental or other authority that are required to be obtained by it with respect to this Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which it is a party and will use all reasonable efforts to obtain any that may become necessary in the future.
(c)       Comply with Laws. It will comply in all material respects with all applicable laws and orders to which it may be subject if failure so to comply would materially impair its ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which it is a party.
(d)       Tax Agreement. It will give notice of any failure of a representation made by it under Section 3(f) to be accurate and true promptly upon learning of such failure.
(e)       Payment of Stamp Tax. Subject to Section 11, it will pay any Stamp Tax levied or imposed upon it or in respect of its execution or performance of this Agreement by a jurisdiction in which it is incorporated,
4 	    	 ISDA ®  1992
organised, managed and controlled, or considered to have its seat, or in which a branch or office through which it is acting for the purpose of this Agreement is located ("Stamp Tax Jurisdiction") and will indemnify the other party against any Stamp Tax levied or imposed upon the other party or in respect of the other party's execution or performance of this Agreement by any such Stamp Tax Jurisdiction which is not also a Stamp Tax Jurisdiction with respect to the other party.
5. 	  Events of Default and Termination Events
(a)       Events of Default. The occurrence at any time with respect to a party or, if applicable, any Credit Support Provider of such party or any Specified Entity of such party of any of the following events constitutes an event of default (an "Event of Default") with respect to such party:--
(i)      Failure to Pay or Deliver. Failure by the party to make, when due, any payment under this Agreement or delivery under Section 2(a)(i) or 2(e) required to be made by it if such failure is not remedied on or before the third Local Business Day after notice of such failure is given to the party;
(ii)    Breach of Agreement. Failure by the party to comply with or perform any agreement or obligation (other than an obligation to make any payment under this Agreement or delivery under Section 2(a)(i) or 2(e) or to give notice of a Termination Event or any agreement or obligation under Section 4(a)(i), 4(a)(iii) or 4(d)) to be complied with or performed by the party in accordance with this Agreement if such failure is not remedied on or before the thirtieth day after notice of such failure is given to the party;
(iii)   Credit Support Default.
(1)    Failure by the party or any Credit Support Provider of such party to comply with or perform any agreement or obligation to be complied with or performed by it in accordance with any Credit Support Document if such failure is continuing after any applicable grace period has elapsed;
(2)    the expiration or termination of such Credit Support Document or the failing or ceasing of such Credit Support Document to be in full force and effect for the purpose of this Agreement (in either case other than in accordance with its terms) prior to the satisfaction of all obligations of such party under each Transaction to which such Credit Support Document relates without the written consent of the other party; or
(3)    the party or such Credit Support Provider disaffirms, disclaims, repudiates or rejects, in whole or in part, or challenges the validity of, such Credit Support Document;
(iv)    Misrepresentation. A representation (other than a representation under Section 3(e) or (f)) made or repeated or deemed to have been made or repeated by the party or any Credit Support Provider of such party in this Agreement or any Credit Support Document proves to have been incorrect or misleading in any material respect when made or repeated or deemed to have been made or repeated;
(v)    Default under Specified Transaction. The party, any Credit Support Provider of such party or any applicable Specified Entity of such party (1) defaults under a Specified Transaction and, after giving effect to any applicable notice requirement or grace period, there occurs a liquidation of, an acceleration of obligations under, or an early termination of, that Specified Transaction, (2) defaults, after giving effect to any applicable notice requirement or grace period, in making any payment or delivery due on the last payment, delivery or exchange date of, or any payment on early termination of, a Specified Transaction (or such default continues for at least three Local Business Days if there is no applicable notice requirement or grace period) or (3) disaffirms, disclaims, repudiates or rejects, in whole or in part, a Specified Transaction (or such action is taken by any person or entity appointed or empowered to operate it or act on its behalf);
(vi)    Cross Default. If "Cross Default" is specified in the Schedule as applying to the party, the occurrence or existence of (1) a default, event of default or other similar condition or event (however
5 	    	 ISDA ®  1992
described) in respect of such party, any Credit Support Provider of such party or any applicable Specified Entity of such party under one or more agreements or instruments relating to Specified Indebtedness of any of them (individually or collectively) in an aggregate amount of not less than the applicable Threshold Amount (as specified in the Schedule) which has resulted in such Specified Indebtedness becoming, or becoming capable at such time of being declared, due and payable under such agreements or instruments, before it would otherwise have been due and payable or (2) a default by such party, such Credit Support Provider or such Specified Entity (individually or collectively) in making one or more payments on the due date thereof in an aggregate amount of not less than the applicable Threshold Amount under such agreements or instruments (after giving effect to any applicable notice requirement or grace period);
(vii)  Bankruptcy. The party, any Credit Support Provider of such party or any applicable Specified Entity of such party: --
(1) is dissolved (other than pursuant to a consolidation, amalgamation or merger); (2) becomes insolvent or is unable to pay its debts or fails or admits in writing its inability generally to pay its debts as they become due;
(3) makes a general assignment, arrangement or composition with or for the benefit of its creditors; (4) institutes or has instituted against it a proceeding seeking a judgment of insolvency or bankruptcy or any other relief under any bankruptcy or insolvency law or other similar law affecting creditors' rights, or a petition is presented for its winding-up or liquidation, and, in the case of any such proceeding or petition instituted or presented against it, such proceeding or petition (A) results in a judgment of insolvency or bankruptcy or the entry of an order for relief or the making of an order for its winding-up or liquidation or (B) is not dismissed, discharged, stayed or restrained in each case within 30 days of the institution or presentation thereof; (5) has a resolution passed for its winding-up, official management or liquidation (other than pursuant to a consolidation, amalgamation or merger); (6) seeks or becomes subject to the appointment of an administrator, provisional liquidator, conservator, receiver, trustee, custodian or other similar official for it or for all or substantially all its assets; (7) has a secured party take possession of all or substantially all its assets or has a distress, execution, attachment, sequestration or other legal process levied, enforced or sued on or against all or substantially all its assets and such secured party maintains possession, or any such process is not dismissed, discharged, stayed or restrained, in each case within 30 days thereafter; (8) causes or is subject to any event with respect to it which, under the applicable laws of any jurisdiction, has an analogous effect to any of the events specified in clauses (1) to (7) (inclusive); or (9) takes any action in furtherance of, or indicating its consent to, approval of, or acquiescence in, any of the foregoing acts; or
(viii)  Merger Without Assumption. The party or any Credit Support Provider of such party consolidates or amalgamates with, or merges with or into, or transfers all or substantially all its assets to, another entity and, at the time of such consolidation, amalgamation, merger or transfer: --
(1)  the resulting, surviving or transferee entity fails to assume all the obligations of such party or such Credit Support Provider under this Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which it or its predecessor was a party by operation of law or pursuant to an agreement reasonably satisfactory to the other party to this Agreement; or
(2)  the benefits of any Credit Support Document fail to extend (without the consent of the other party) to the performance by such resulting, surviving or transferee entity of its obligations under this Agreement.
(b)       Termination Events. The occurrence at any time with respect to a party or, if applicable, any Credit Support Provider of such party or any Specified Entity of such party of any event specified below constitutes an Illegality if the event is specified in (i) below, a Tax Event if the event is specified in (ii) below or a Tax Event Upon Merger if the event is specified in (iii) below, and, if specified to be applicable, a Credit Event
6 	    	 ISDA ®  1992
Upon Merger if the event is specified pursuant to (iv) below or an Additional Termination Event if the event is specified pursuant to (v) below:--
(i)     Illegality. Due to the adoption of, or any change in, any applicable law after the date on which a Transaction is entered into, or due to the promulgation of, or any change in, the interpretation by any court, tribunal or regulatory authority with competent jurisdiction of any applicable law after such date, it becomes unlawful (other than as a result of a breach by the party of Section 4(b)) for such party (which will be the Affected Party): --
(1)    to perform any absolute or contingent obligation to make a payment or delivery or to receive a payment or delivery in respect of such Transaction or to comply with any other material provision of this Agreement relating to such Transaction; or
(2)    to perform, or for any Credit Support Provider of such party to perform, any contingent or other obligation which the party (or such Credit Support Provider) has under any Credit Support Document relating to such Transaction;
(ii)    Tax Event. Due to (x) any action taken by a taxing authority, or brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, on or after the date on which a Transaction is entered into (regardless of whether such action is taken or brought with respect to a party to this Agreement) or (y) a Change in Tax Law, the party (which will be the Affected Party) will, or there is a substantial likelihood that it will, on the next succeeding Scheduled Payment Date (1) be required to pay to the other party an additional amount in respect of an Indemnifiable Tax under Section 2(d)(i)(4) (except in respect of interest under Section 2(e), 6(d)(ii) or 6(e)) or (2) receive a payment from which an amount is required to be deducted or withheld for or on account of a Tax (except in respect of interest under Section 2(e), 6(d)(ii) or 6(e)) and no additional amount is required to be paid in respect of such Tax under Section 2(d)(i)(4) (other than by reason of Section 2(d)(i)(4)(A) or (B));
(iii)    Tax Event Upon Merger. The party (the "Burdened Party") on the next succeeding Scheduled Payment Date will either (1) be required to pay an additional amount in respect of an Indemnifiable Tax under Section 2(d)(i)(4) (except in respect of interest under Section 2(e), 6(d)(ii) or 6(e)) or (2) receive a payment from which an amount has been deducted or withheld for or on account of any Indemnifiable Tax in respect of which the other party is not required to pay an additional amount (other than by reason of Section 2(d)(i)(4)(A) or (B)), in either case as a result of a party consolidating or amalgamating with, or merging with or into, or transferring all or substantially all its assets to, another entity (which will be the Affected Party) where such action does not constitute an event described in Section 5(a)(viii);
(iv)    Credit Event Upon Merger. If "Credit Event Upon Merger" is specified in the Schedule as applying to the party, such party ("X"), any Credit Support Provider of X or any applicable Specified Entity of X consolidates or amalgamates with, or merges with or into, or transfers all or substantially all its assets to, another entity and such action does not constitute an event described in Section 5(a)(viii) but the creditworthiness of the resulting, surviving or transferee entity is materially weaker than that of X, such Credit Support Provider or such Specified Entity, as the case may be, immediately prior to such action (and, in such event, X or its successor or transferee, as appropriate, will be the Affected Party); or
(v)    Additional Termination Event. If any "Additional Termination Event" is specified in the Schedule or any Confirmation as applying, the occurrence of such event (and, in such event, the Affected Party or Affected Parties shall be as specified for such Additional Termination Event in the Schedule or such Confirmation).
(c)       Event of Default and Illegality. If an event or circumstance which would otherwise constitute or give rise to an Event of Default also constitutes an Illegality, it will be treated as an Illegality and will not constitute an Event of Default.
7 	    	 ISDA ®  1992
6. 	  Early Termination
(a)       Right to Terminate Following Event of Default. If at any time an Event of Default with respect to a party (the "Defaulting Party") has occurred and is then continuing, the other party (the "Non-defaulting Party") may, by not more than 20 days notice to the Defaulting Party specifying the relevant Event of Default, designate a day not earlier than the day such notice is effective as an Early Termination Date in respect of all outstanding Transactions. If, however, "Automatic Early Termination" is specified in the Schedule as applying to a party, then an Early Termination Date in respect of all outstanding Transactions will occur immediately upon the occurrence with respect to such party of an Event of Default specified in Section 5(a)(vii)(1), (3), (5), (6) or, to the extent analogous thereto, (8), and as of the time immediately preceding the institution of the relevant proceeding or the presentation of the relevant petition upon the occurrence with respect to such party of an Event of Default specified in Section 5(a)(vii)(4) or, to the extent analogous thereto, (8).
(b)       Right to Terminate Following Termination Event.
(i)      Notice. If a Termination Event occurs, an Affected Party will, promptly upon becoming aware of it, notify the other party, specifying the nature of that Termination Event and each Affected Transaction and will also give such other information about that Termination Event as the other party may reasonably require.
(ii)    Transfer to Avoid Termination Event. If either an Illegality under Section 5(b)(i)(1) or a Tax Event occurs and there is only one Affected Party, or if a Tax Event Upon Merger occurs and the Burdened Party is the Affected Party, the Affected Party will, as a condition to its right to designate an Early Termination Date under Section 6(b)(iv), use all reasonable efforts (which will not require such party to incur a loss, excluding immaterial, incidental expenses) to transfer within 20 days after it gives notice under Section 6(b)(i) all its rights and obligations under this Agreement in respect of the Affected Transactions to another of its Offices or Affiliates so that such Termination Event ceases to exist.
If the Affected Party is not able to make such a transfer it will give notice to the other party to that effect within such 20 day period, whereupon the other party may effect such a transfer within 30 days after the notice is given under Section 6(b)(i).
Any such transfer by a party under this Section 6(b)(ii) will be subject to and conditional upon the prior written consent of the other party, which consent will not be withheld if such other party's policies in effect at such time would permit it to enter into transactions with the transferee on the terms proposed.
(iii)   Two Affected Parties. If an Illegality under Section 5(b)(i)(1) or a Tax Event occurs and there are two Affected Parties, each party will use all reasonable efforts to reach agreement within 30 days after notice thereof is given under Section 6(b)(i) on action to avoid that Termination Event.
(iv)    Right to Terminate. If: --
(1)    a transfer under Section 6(b)(ii) or an agreement under Section 6(b)(iii), as the case may be, has not been effected with respect to all Affected Transactions within 30 days after an Affected Party gives notice under Section 6(b)(i); or
(2)    an Illegality under Section 5(b)(i)(2), a Credit Event Upon Merger or an Additional Termination Event occurs, or a Tax Event Upon Merger occurs and the Burdened Party is not the Affected Party,
either party in the case of an Illegality, the Burdened Party in the case of a Tax Event Upon Merger, any Affected Party in the case of a Tax Event or an Additional Termination Event if there is more than one Affected Party, or the party which is not the Affected Party in the case of a Credit Event Upon Merger or an Additional Termination Event if there is only one Affected Party may, by not more than 20 days notice to the other party and provided that the relevant Termination Event is then
8 	    	 ISDA ®  1992
continuing, designate a day not earlier than the day such notice is effective as an Early Termination Date in respect of all Affected Transactions.
(c)       Effect of Designation.
(i)    If notice designating an Early Termination Date is given under Section 6(a) or (b), the Early Termination Date will occur on the date so designated, whether or not the relevant Event of Default or Termination Event is then continuing.
(ii)   Upon the occurrence or effective designation of an Early Termination Date, no further payments or deliveries under Section 2(a)(i) or 2(e) in respect of the Terminated Transactions will be required to be made, but without prejudice to the other provisions of this Agreement. The amount, if any, payable in respect of an Early Termination Date shall be determined pursuant to Section 6(e).
(d)       Calculations.
(i)    Statement. On or as soon as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of an Early Termination Date, each party will make the calculations on its part, if any, contemplated by Section 6(e) and will provide to the other party a statement (1) showing, in reasonable detail, such calculations (including all relevant quotations and specifying any amount payable under Section 6(e)) and (2) giving details of the relevant account to which any amount payable to it is to be paid. In the absence of written confirmation from the source of a quotation obtained in determining a Market Quotation, the records of the party obtaining such quotation will be conclusive evidence of the existence and accuracy of such quotation.
(ii)    Payment Date. An amount calculated as being due in respect of any Early Termination Date under Section 6(e) will be payable on the day that notice of the amount payable is effective (in the case of an Early Termination Date which is designated or occurs as a result of an Event of Default) and on the day which is two Local Business Days after the day on which notice of the amount payable is effective (in the case of an Early Termination Date which is designated as a result of a Termination Event). Such amount will be paid together with (to the extent permitted under applicable law) interest thereon (before as well as after judgment) in the Termination Currency, from (and including) the relevant Early Termination Date to (but excluding) the date such amount is paid, at the Applicable Rate. Such interest will be calculated on the basis of daily compounding and the actual number of days elapsed.
(e)       Payments on Early Termination. If an Early Termination Date occurs, the following provisions shall apply based on the parties' election in the Schedule of a payment measure, either "Market Quotation" or "Loss", and a payment method, either the "First Method" or the "Second Method". If the parties fail to designate a payment measure or payment method in the Schedule, it will be deemed that "Market Quotation" or the "Second Method", as the case may be, shall apply. The amount, if any, payable in respect of an Early Termination Date and determined pursuant to this Section will be subject to any Set-off.
(i)    Events of Default. If the Early Termination Date results from an Event of Default: --
(1)    First Method and Market Quotation. If the First Method and Market Quotation apply, the Defaulting Party will pay to the Non-defaulting Party the excess, if a positive number, of (A) the sum of the Settlement Amount (determined by the Non-defaulting Party) in respect of the Terminated Transactions and the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to the Non-defaulting Party over (B) the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to the Defaulting Party.
(2)    First Method and Loss. If the First Method and Loss apply, the Defaulting Party will pay to the Non-defaulting Party, if a positive number, the Non-defaulting Party's Loss in respect of this Agreement.
(3)    Second Method and Market Quotation. If the Second Method and Market Quotation apply, an amount will be payable equal to (A) the sum of the Settlement Amount (determined by the
9 	    	 ISDA ®  1992
Non-defaulting Party) in respect of the Terminated Transactions and the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to the Non- defaulting Party less (B) the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to the Defaulting Party. If that amount is a positive number, the Defaulting Party will pay it to the Non-defaulting Party; if it is a negative number, the Non-defaulting Party will pay the absolute value of that amount to the Defaulting Party.
(4)    Second Method and Loss. If the Second Method and Loss apply, an amount will be payable equal to the Non-defaulting Party's Loss in respect of this Agreement. If that amount is a positive number, the Defaulting Party will pay it to the Non-defaulting Party; if it is a negative number, the Non- defaulting Party will pay the absolute value of that amount to the Defaulting Party.
(ii)    Termination Events.  If the Early Termination Date results from a Termination Event: --
(1)    One Affected Party. If there is one Affected Party, the amount payable will be determined in accordance with Section 6(e)(i)(3), if Market Quotation applies, or Section 6(e)(i)(4), if Loss applies, except that, in either case, references to the Defaulting Party and to the Non-defaulting Party will be deemed to be references to the Affected Party and the party which is not the Affected Party, respectively, and, if Loss applies and fewer than all the Transactions are being terminated, Loss shall be calculated in respect of all Terminated Transactions.
(2)    Two Affected Parties.If there are two Affected Parties: --
(A)  if Market Quotation applies, each party will determine a Settlement Amount in respect of the Terminated Transactions, and an amount will be payable equal to (I) the sum of (a) one-half of the difference between the Settlement Amount of the party with the higher Settlement Amount ("X") and the Settlement Amount of the party with the lower Settlement Amount ("Y") and (b) the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to X less (II) the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to Y; and
(B)  if Loss applies, each party will determine its Loss in respect of this Agreement (or, if fewer than all the Transactions are being terminated, in respect of all Terminated Transactions) and an amount will be payable equal to one-half of the difference between the Loss of the party with the higher Loss ("X") and the Loss of the party with the lower Loss ("Y").
If the amount payable is a positive number, Y will pay it to X; if it is a negative number, X will pay the absolute value of that amount to Y.
(iii)    Adjustment for Bankruptcy. In circumstances where an Early Termination Date occurs because "Automatic Early Termination" applies in respect of a party, the amount determined under this Section 6(e) will be subject to such adjustments as are appropriate and permitted by law to reflect any payments or deliveries made by one party to the other under this Agreement (and retained by such other party) during the period from the relevant Early Termination Date to the date for payment determined under Section 6(d)(ii).
(iv)    Pre-Estimate. The parties agree that if Market Quotation applies an amount recoverable under this Section 6(e) is a reasonable pre-estimate of loss and not a penalty. Such amount is payable for the loss of bargain and the loss of protection against future risks and except as otherwise provided in this Agreement neither party will be entitled to recover any additional damages as a consequence of such losses.
10 	    	 ISDA ®  1992
7. 	  Transfer
Subject to Section 6(b)(ii), neither this Agreement nor any interest or obligation in or under this Agreement may be transferred (whether by way of security or otherwise) by either party without the prior written consent of the other party, except that: --
(a)       a party may make such a transfer of this Agreement pursuant to a consolidation or amalgamation with, or merger with or into, or transfer of all or substantially all its assets to, another entity (but without prejudice to any other right or remedy under this Agreement); and
(b)       a party may make such a transfer of all or any part of its interest in any amount payable to it from a Defaulting Party under Section 6(e).
Any purported transfer that is not in compliance with this Section will be void.
8. 	  Contractual Currency
(a)       Payment in the Contractual Currency. Each payment under this Agreement will be made in the relevant currency specified in this Agreement for that payment (the "Contractual Currency"). To the extent permitted by applicable law, any obligation to make payments under this Agreement in the Contractual Currency will not be discharged or satisfied by any tender in any currency other than the Contractual Currency, except to the extent such tender results in the actual receipt by the party to which payment is owed, acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith in converting the currency so tendered into the Contractual Currency, of the full amount in the Contractual Currency of all amounts payable in respect of this Agreement. If for any reason the amount in the Contractual Currency so received falls short of the amount in the Contractual Currency payable in respect of this Agreement, the party required to make the payment will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, immediately pay such additional amount in the Contractual Currency as may be necessary to compensate for the shortfall. If for any reason the amount in the Contractual Currency so received exceeds the amount in the Contractual Currency payable in respect of this Agreement, the party receiving the payment will refund promptly the amount of such excess.
(b)       Judgments. To the extent permitted by applicable law, if any judgment or order expressed in a currency other than the Contractual Currency is rendered (i) for the payment of any amount owing in respect of this Agreement, (ii) for the payment of any amount relating to any early termination in respect of this Agreement or (iii) in respect of a judgment or order of another court for the payment of any amount described in (i) or (ii) above, the party seeking recovery, after recovery in full of the aggregate amount to which such party is entitled pursuant to the judgment or order, will be entitled to receive immediately from the other party the amount of any shortfall of the Contractual Currency received by such party as a consequence of sums paid in such other currency and will refund promptly to the other party any excess of the Contractual Currency received by such party as a consequence of sums paid in such other currency if such shortfall or such excess arises or results from any variation between the rate of exchange at which the Contractual Currency is converted into the currency of the judgment or order for the purposes of such judgment or order and the rate of exchange at which such party is able, acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith in converting the currency received into the Contractual Currency, to purchase the Contractual Currency with the amount of the currency of the judgment or order actually received by such party. The term "rate of exchange" includes, without limitation, any premiums and costs of exchange payable in connection with the purchase of or conversion into the Contractual Currency.
(c)       Separate Indemnities. To the extent permitted by applicable law, these indemnities constitute separate and independent obligations from the other obligations in this Agreement, will be enforceable as separate and independent causes of action, will apply notwithstanding any indulgence granted by the party to which any payment is owed and will not be affected by judgment being obtained or claim or proof being made for any other sums payable in respect of this Agreement.
(d)       Evidence of Loss. For the purpose of this Section 8, it will be sufficient for a party to demonstrate that it would have suffered a loss had an actual exchange or purchase been made.
11 	    	 ISDA ®  1992
9. 	  Miscellaneous
(a)       Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding of the parties with respect to its subject matter and supersedes all oral communication and prior writings with respect thereto.
(b)       Amendments. No amendment, modification or waiver in respect of this Agreement will be effective unless in writing (including a writing evidenced by a facsimile transmission) and executed by each of the parties or confirmed by an exchange of telexes or electronic messages on an electronic messaging system.
(c)       Survival of Obligations. Without prejudice to Sections 2(a)(iii) and 6(c)(ii), the obligations of the parties under this Agreement will survive the termination of any Transaction.
(d)       Remedies Cumulative. Except as provided in this Agreement, the rights, powers, remedies and privileges provided in this Agreement are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, powers, remedies and privileges provided by law.
(e)       Counterparts and Confirmations.
(i)  This Agreement (and each amendment, modification and waiver in respect of it) may be executed and delivered in counterparts (including by facsimile transmission), each of which will be deemed an original.
(ii) The parties intend that they are legally bound by the terms of each Transaction from the moment they agree to those terms (whether orally or otherwise). A Confirmation shall be entered into as soon as practicable and may be executed and delivered in counterparts (including by facsimile transmission) or be created by an exchange of telexes or by an exchange of electronic messages on an electronic messaging system, which in each case will be sufficient for all purposes to evidence a binding supplement to this Agreement. The parties will specify therein or through another effective means that any such counterpart, telex or electronic message constitutes a Confirmation.
(f)       No Waiver of Rights. A failure or delay in exercising any right, power or privilege in respect of this Agreement will not be presumed to operate as a waiver, and a single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege will not be presumed to preclude any subsequent or further exercise, of that right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.
(g)       Headings. The headings used in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and are not to affect the construction of or to be taken into consideration in interpreting this Agreement.
10. 	  Offices; Multibranch Parties
(a)       If Section 10(a) is specified in the Schedule as applying, each party that enters into a Transaction through an Office other than its head or home office represents to the other party that, notwithstanding the place of booking office or jurisdiction of incorporation or organisation of such party, the obligations of such party are the same as if it had entered into the Transaction through its head or home office. This representation will be deemed to be repeated by such party on each date on which a Transaction is entered into.
(b)       Neither party may change the Office through which it makes and receives payments or deliveries for the purpose of a Transaction without the prior written consent of the other party.
(c)       If a party is specified as a Multibranch Party in the Schedule, such Multibranch Party may make and receive payments or deliveries under any Transaction through any Office listed in the Schedule, and the Office through which it makes and receives payments or deliveries with respect to a Transaction will be specified in the relevant Confirmation.
11. 	  Expenses
A Defaulting Party will, on demand, indemnify and hold harmless the other party for and against all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including legal fees and Stamp Tax, incurred by such other party by reason of the enforcement and protection of its rights under this Agreement or any Credit Support Document
12 	    	 ISDA ®  1992
to which the Defaulting Party is a party or by reason of the early termination of any Transaction, including, but not limited to, costs of collection.
12. 	  Notices

(v)   if sent by electronic messaging system, on the date that electronic message is received,
unless the date of that delivery (or attempted delivery) or that receipt, as applicable, is not a Local Business Day or that communication is delivered (or attempted) or received, as applicable, after the close of business on a Local Business Day, in which case that communication shall be deemed given and effective on the first following day that is a Local Business Day.
(b)      Change of Addresses. Either party may by notice to the other change the address, telex or facsimile number or electronic messaging system details at which notices or other communications are to be given to it.
13. 	  Governing Law and Jurisdiction
(a)      Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the law specified in the Schedule.
(b)      Jurisdiction. With respect to any suit, action or proceedings relating to this Agreement ("Proceedings"), each party irrevocably:--
(i)    submits to the jurisdiction of the English courts, if this Agreement is expressed to be governed by English law, or to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York and the United States District Court located in the Borough of Manhattan in New York City, if this Agreement is expressed to be governed by the laws of the State of New York; and
(ii)   waives any objection which it may have at any time to the laying of venue of any Proceedings brought in any such court, waives any claim that such Proceedings have been brought in an inconvenient forum and further waives the right to object, with respect to such Proceedings, that such court does not have any jurisdiction over such party.
Nothing in this Agreement precludes either party from bringing Proceedings in any other jurisdiction (outside, if this Agreement is expressed to be governed by English law, the Contracting States, as defined in Section 1(3) of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982 or any modification, extension or re-enactment thereof for the time being in force) nor will the bringing of Proceedings in any one or more jurisdictions preclude the bringing of Proceedings in any other jurisdiction.

13 	    	 ISDA ®  1992
reason any party's Process Agent is unable to act as such, such party will promptly notify the other party and within 30 days appoint a substitute process agent acceptable to the other party. The parties irrevocably consent to service of process given in the manner provided for notices in Section 12\.
Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of either party to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.
(d)      Waiver of Immunities. Each party irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, with respect to itself and its revenues and assets (irrespective of their use or intended use), all immunity on the grounds of sovereignty or other similar grounds from (i) suit, (ii) jurisdiction of any court, (iii) relief by way of injunction, order for specific performance or for recovery of property, (iv) attachment of its assets (whether before or after judgment) and (v) execution or enforcement of any judgment to which it or its revenues or assets might otherwise be entitled in any Proceedings in the courts of any jurisdiction and irrevocably agrees, to the extent permitted by applicable law, that it will not claim any such immunity in any Proceedings.

Loss includes losses and costs (or gains) in respect of any payment or delivery required to have been made (assuming satisfaction of each applicable condition precedent) on or before the relevant Early Termination Date and not made, except, so as to avoid duplication, if Section 6(e)(i)(1) or (3) or 6(e)(ii)(2)(A) applies. Loss does not include a party's legal fees and out-of-pocket expenses referred to under Section 11\. A party will determine its Loss as of the relevant Early Termination Date, or, if that is not reasonably practicable, as of the earliest date thereafter as is reasonably practicable.

" Market Quotation" means, with respect to one or more Terminated Transactions and a party making the determination, an amount determined on the basis of quotations from Reference Market-makers. Each quotation will be for an amount, if any, that would be paid to such party (expressed as a negative number) or by such party (expressed as a positive number) in consideration of an agreement between such party (taking into account any existing Credit Support Document with respect to the obligations of such party) and the quoting Reference Market-maker to enter into a transaction (the "Replacement Transaction") that would have the effect of preserving for such party the economic equivalent of any payment or delivery (whether the underlying obligation was absolute or contingent and assuming the satisfaction of each applicable condition precedent) by the parties under Section 2(a)(i) in respect of such Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions that would, but for the occurrence of the relevant Early Termination Date, have
15 	    	 ISDA ®  1992
been required after that date. For this purpose, Unpaid Amounts in respect of the Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions are to be excluded but, without limitation, any payment or delivery that would, but for the relevant Early Termination Date, have been required (assuming satisfaction of each applicable condition precedent) after that Early Termination Date is to be included. The Replacement Transaction would be subject to such documentation as such party and the Reference Market-maker may, in good faith, agree. The party making the determination (or its agent) will request each Reference Market-maker to provide its quotation to the extent reasonably practicable as of the same day and time (without regard to different time zones) on or as soon as reasonably practicable after the relevant Early Termination Date. The day and time as of which those quotations are to be obtained will be selected in good faith by the party obliged to make a determination under Section 6(e), and, if each party is so obliged, after consultation with the other. If more than three quotations are provided, the Market Quotation will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations, without regard to the quotations having the highest and lowest values. If exactly three such quotations are provided, the Market Quotation will be the quotation remaining after disregarding the highest and lowest quotations. For this purpose, if more than one quotation has the same highest value or lowest value, then one of such quotations shall be disregarded. If fewer than three quotations are provided, it will be deemed that the Market Quotation in respect of such Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions cannot be determined.

" Relevant Jurisdiction" means, with respect to a party, the jurisdictions (a) in which the party is incorporated, organised, managed and controlled or considered to have its seat, (b) where an Office through which the party is acting for purposes of this Agreement is located, (c) in which the party executes this Agreement and (d) in relation to any payment, from or through which such payment is made.
" Scheduled Payment Date" means a date on which a payment or delivery is to be made under Section 2(a)(i) with respect to a Transaction.
" Set-off" means set-off, offset, combination of accounts, right of retention or withholding or similar right or requirement to which the payer of an amount under Section 6 is entitled or subject (whether arising under this Agreement, another contract, applicable law or otherwise) that is exercised by, or imposed on, such payer.

(a)     the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Market Quotations (whether positive or negative) for each Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions for which a Market Quotation is determined; and
(b)     such party's Loss (whether positive or negative and without reference to any Unpaid Amounts) for each Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions for which a Market Quotation cannot be determined or would not (in the reasonable belief of the party making the determination) produce a commercially reasonable result.

The foreign exchange agent will, if only one party is obliged to make a determination under Section 6(e), be selected in good faith by that party and otherwise will be agreed by the parties.
" Termination Event" means an Illegality, a Tax Event or a Tax Event Upon Merger or, if specified to be applicable, a Credit Event Upon Merger or an Additional Termination Event.
" Termination Rate" means a rate per annum equal to the arithmetic mean of the cost (without proof or evidence of any actual cost) to each party (as certified by such party) if it were to fund or of funding such amounts.
" Unpaid Amounts" owing to any party means, with respect to an Early Termination Date, the aggregate of (a) in respect of all Terminated Transactions, the amounts that became payable (or that would have become payable but for Section 2(a)(iii)) to such party under Section 2(a)(i) on or prior to such Early Termination Date and which remain unpaid as at such Early Termination Date and (b) in respect of each Terminated Transaction, for each obligation under Section 2(a)(i) which was (or would have been but for Section 2(a)(iii)) required to be settled by delivery to such party on or prior to such Early Termination Date and which has not been so settled as at such Early Termination Date, an amount equal to the fair market

value of that which was (or would have been) required to be delivered as of the originally scheduled date for delivery, in each case together with (to the extent permitted under applicable law) interest, in the currency of such amounts, from (and including) the date such amounts or obligations were or would have been required to have been paid or performed to (but excluding) such Early Termination Date, at the Applicable Rate. Such amounts of interest will be calculated on the basis of daily compounding and the actual number of days elapsed. The fair market value of any obligation referred to in clause
(b) above shall be reasonably determined by the party obliged to make the determination under Section 6(e) or, if each party is so obliged, it shall be the average of the Termination Currency Equivalents of the fair market values reasonably determined by both parties.

However, if an amount in respect of an Early Termination Date is payable by Party B (the " Party B Termination Amount") pursuant to Section 6(e), Party B will pay that amount (together with interest calculated in accordance with Section 6(d)(ii)) in Australian dollars. For this purpose, the Party B Termination Amount will be converted into Australian dollars by applying the definition of "Termination Currency Equivalent" in the Agreement as if the amount payable by Party B (in Australian dollars) is the "amount in the Termination Currency", the "Termination Currency" is Australian dollars, the "Other Currency" is US Dollars and the Party B Termination Amount is an "amount denominated in a currency other than the Termination Currency".

(i) 	  Non-Reliance. It is acting for its own account (or, in the case of Party B, as trustee of the Series Trust), and it has made its own independent decisions to enter into that Transaction and as to whether that Transaction is appropriate or proper for it based upon its own judgment (and in the case of Party B, also on the judgment of the Manager) and upon advice from such advisers as it has deemed necessary. It is not relying on any communication (written or oral) of any other party as investment advice or as a recommendation to enter into that Transaction; it being understood that information and explanations related to the terms and conditions of a Transaction will not be considered investment advice or a recommendation to enter into that Transaction. No communication (written or oral) received from any other party will be deemed to be an assurance or guarantee as to the expected results of that Transaction.

(iv) 	  Power. It has power under the Master Trust Deed to enter into this Agreement and the Credit Support Documents in relation to Party B in its capacity as trustee of the Series Trust.
(v) 	  Good Title. Subject only to the Credit Support Documents in relation to Party B and any Security Interest permitted under the Credit Support Documents in relation to Party B, and to
the best of its knowledge without due enquiry, it has not taken any steps to create any Security Interests over the assets of the Series Trust (except for Party B's right of indemnity out of the Assets of the Series Trust).
(vi) 	  No breach. To the best of its knowledge, it is not in breach of any material provisions of the Master Trust Deed or the Transaction Documents of the Series Trust.
(vii) 	  No Restriction. Except as expressly provided in the Transaction Documents for the Series Trust, there is no restriction on its right of recourse or indemnity to or out of the Assets of the Series Trust and nothing has happened which could impair its right of indemnity out of the Assets of the Series Trust.
(viii) 	  Benefit. Party B's entry into this Agreement and each Transaction is for the benefit of and is in the interests of the beneficiaries of the Series Trust.

(l) 	  Financial Data. By Party A, in respect of Party A only, each Swap Financial Disclosure provided by Party A under Part 3(b) of the Schedule and the information contained in the first, second, third and fourth paragraphs under the heading "The Currency Swaps and the Fixed Rate Swap--The Currency Swaps--The Currency Swap Provider" in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus:

(a) 	  Termination by Party B: Party B must not (and the Manager must not direct it to) designate an Early Termination Date without the prior written consent of the Relevant Note Trustee.
(b) 	  Consultation on Early Termination Date: Each party must use reasonable endeavours (which will not require such party to incur a loss or result in a reduction in the amounts that would be payable by one party to another as a consequence of the designation of the Early Termination Date) to consult with the other parties to this Agreement as to the timing of the Early Termination Date prior to the designation of an Early Termination Date, provided that this provision will not affect a party's right to designate an Early Termination Date under any other provision of this Agreement.
(c) 	  Transfers to avoid Termination:
Section 6(b)(ii) is amended as follows:
(i) 	  The following sentences are added at the end of the second paragraph:
"However, if Party A is that other party it must use reasonable efforts to make such a transfer to an Affiliate provided the Rating Agencies have been notified by the Manager or by Party A (with a copy to the Manager) in writing in relation to the Relevant Notes in respect of such a transfer. Party A will not be required to incur a loss, excluding immaterial incidental expenses, in connection with any such transfer."
(ii) 	  The third paragraph is deleted and replaced with the following:
"Any such transfer by a party under this Section 6(b)(ii) will be subject to and conditional upon the prior written consent of the other party, which consent will not be withheld:
(1) 	  where the other party is Party A, if Party A's policies in effect at such time would permit it to enter into transactions with the transferee on the terms proposed; or
(2) 	  where the other party is Party B, if the Rating Agencies have been notified by the Manager or by Party A (with a copy to the Manager) in writing in respect of such transfer."
(d) 	  Termination Payments by Party B: Notwithstanding Section 6(d)(ii), prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined under the Security Trust Deed) and the enforcement of the Security (as defined in the General Security Deed) under the Security Trust Deed and the General Security Deed, any amount calculated as being due by Party B in respect of any Early Termination Date under Section 6(e) will be payable (along with interest on the outstanding amount from that Early Termination Date to the date of payment in accordance with Section 6(d)) on the Distribution Date (as specified in the relevant Confirmation) immediately following the date that such amount would otherwise be payable under Section 6(d)(ii) (or will be payable on that date if that date is a Distribution Date) except to the extent that such amount is fully satisfied from the payment of an upfront premium by the provider in respect of a Replacement Currency Swap in accordance with Part 5(16)(b).
(7) 	  Set-Off: Section 6(e) is amended by deleting the last sentence of the first paragraph.
(8) 	  Transfer:

(i) 	  have the effect of preserving for Party B the economic equivalent of all payment and delivery obligations (whether absolute or contingent and assuming the satisfaction of each applicable condition precedent) under this Agreement immediately before such transfer; and
(ii) 	  are, in all material respects, no less beneficial for Party B than the terms of this Agreement immediately before such transfer, as determined by Party B (acting on the direction of the Manager).
In determining whether or not a transfer satisfies the conditions in paragraph (d)(ii), Party B (acting on the direction of the Manager) shall act in a commercially reasonable manner.
If an entity has made a Firm Offer (which remains capable of becoming legally binding upon acceptance) to be the transferee of a transfer to be made in accordance with paragraph (d), Party B shall, at Party A's written request and cost, take any reasonable steps required to be taken by it to effect such transfer; and
(e) 	  subject to giving prior written notification to Party B, if an Initial Fitch Rating Event, a Subsequent Fitch Rating Event or a Second Subsequent Fitch Rating Event has occurred, Party A may (at its own cost) transfer all or substantially all its rights and obligations with respect to this Agreement to any other entity that is a Fitch Eligible Replacement.".
(9) 	  Facsimile Transmission: In Section 12:
(a) 	  replace Section 12(a)(iii) with:

(a) 	  Master Trust Deed and Series Supplement: subject to Part 5(10)(h), unless defined in this Agreement words and phrases defined (including by incorporation from, or by reference to, another document) in the Master Trust Deed and the Series Supplement have the same meaning in this Agreement. Subject to Part 5(10)(f), where there is any inconsistency in a definition between this Agreement (on the one hand) and the Master Trust Deed or the Series Supplement (on the other hand), this Agreement prevails. Where there is any inconsistency in a definition between the Master Trust Deed, (on the one hand) and the Series Supplement (on the other hand), the Series Supplement prevails over the Master Trust Deed in respect of the Series Trust.

of Party A to deliver collateral to Party B in accordance with the Moody's Credit Support Annex in compliance with Section 17(b)(ii) in respect of such Subsequent Moody's Rating Event will cease and the Credit Support Amount under the Moody's Credit Support Annex will (despite any inconsistency with the Moody's Credit Support Annex) be taken to be zero.
(c) 	  (Additional Action): Where the Moody's Second Rating Trigger Requirements apply and Party A elects to take the action referred to in Section 17(b)(ii), Party A must also take one of the actions referred to in Section 17(b)(iii) as soon as is reasonably practicable using commercially reasonable efforts to do so following the occurrence of the Subsequent Moody's Rating Event.
(d) 	  (Close-Out Calculations): If an Early Termination Date is designated at a time when Party A is the Affected Party in respect of an Additional Termination Event or the Defaulting Party in respect of any Event of Default, paragraphs (i) to (v) below shall apply:
(i) 	  The following definition of "Market Quotation " shall apply:
""Market Quotation " means, with respect to one or more Terminated Transactions, a Firm Offer which is:
(A) 	  made by a Reference Market-maker that is a Moody's Eligible Replacement;
(B) 	  for an amount that would be paid to Party B (expressed as a negative number) or by Party B (expressed as a positive number) in consideration of an agreement between Party B and such Reference Market-maker that is a Moody's Eligible Replacement to enter into a transaction (the "Replacement Transaction ") that would have the effect of preserving for Party B the economic equivalent of any payment or delivery (whether the underlying obligation was absolute or contingent and assuming the satisfaction of each applicable condition precedent) by the parties under this Agreement in respect of such Terminated Transactions or group of Terminated Transactions that would, but for the occurrence of the relevant Early Termination Date, have been required after that Early Termination Date;
(C) 	  made on the basis that Unpaid Amounts in respect of the Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions are to be excluded but, without limitation, any payment or delivery that would, but for the relevant Early Termination Date, have been required (assuming satisfaction of each applicable condition precedent) after that Early Termination Date is to be included; and
(D) 	  made in respect of a Replacement Transaction with terms that are, in all material respects, no less beneficial for Party B than those of this Agreement (save for the exclusion of provisions relating to Transactions that are not Terminated Transactions), as determined by Party B (at the direction of the Manager)."
(ii) 	  In determining whether or not a Firm Offer satisfies the condition in sub-paragraph (D) of Market Quotation, the Manager (in directing Party B) and Party B (acting at the direction of the Manager) shall act in a commercially reasonable manner.
(iii) 	  The definition of "Settlement Amount " shall be replaced with the following:
""Settlement Amount " means, with respect to any Early Termination Date:
(A) 	  if, on or prior to such Early Termination Date, a Market Quotation for the relevant Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions is accepted by Party B (at the direction of the Manager) so as to become legally binding, the Termination Currency Equivalent of the amount (whether positive or negative) of such Market Quotation;
(B) 	  if, on such Early Termination Date, the Manager has not directed Party B to accept a Market Quotation for the relevant Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions so as to become legally binding and one or more Market Quotations have been communicated to the Manager and Party B and remain capable of becoming legally binding upon acceptance by Party B, the Termination Currency Equivalent of the amount (whether positive or negative) of the lowest of such Market Quotations, and for the avoidance of doubt:
(i) 	  a Market Quotation expressed as a negative number is lower than a Market Quotation expressed as a positive number; and
(ii) 	  the lower of two Market Quotations expressed as negative numbers is the one with the largest absolute value; or
(C) 	  if, on such Early Termination Date, the Manager has not directed Party B to accept a Market Quotation for the relevant Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions so as to become legally binding and no Market Quotations have been communicated to the Manager and Party B and remain capable of becoming legally binding upon acceptance by Party B, Party B's Loss (whether positive or negative and without reference to any Unpaid Amounts) for the relevant Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions."
(iv) 	  At any time on or before the Early Termination Date at which two or more Market Quotations have been communicated to Party B and remain capable of becoming legally binding upon acceptance by Party B, Party B shall be entitled (at the direction of the Manager) to accept only the lowest of such Market Quotations, and for the avoidance of doubt:
(A) 	  a Market Quotation expressed as a negative number is lower than a Market Quotation expressed as a positive number; and
(B) 	  the lower of two Market Quotations expressed as negative numbers is the one with the largest absolute value.
(v) 	  If the Manager requests Party A in writing to obtain Market Quotations, Party A shall use reasonable efforts to do so before the Early Termination Date.
(e) 	  (Moody 's Additional Termination Event): An Additional Termination Event will occur if, at any time, all of the following are satisfied:
(i) 	  the counterparty risk assessments or credit ratings, as applicable, of Party A or any Credit Support Provider of Party A were less than the Moody's Second Trigger Required Ratings for a continuous period of 30 Local Business Days or more; and
(ii) 	  Party A has not procured an Eligible Guarantee by a guarantor with counterparty risk assessments or credit ratings, as applicable, higher than or equal to Moody's Second Trigger Required Ratings or a transfer in accordance with Section 17(b)(iii)(A) above; and
(iii) 	  at least one Moody's Eligible Replacement has made a Firm Offer that would, assuming the occurrence of an Additional Termination Event, qualify as a Market Quotation (on the basis that Section 17(d)(i) and Section 17(d)(ii) of the Schedule apply) and which remains capable of becoming legally binding upon acceptance.
For the purposes of any Additional Termination Event occurring under this Section 17(e), Party A is the sole Affected Party and all Transactions are Affected Transactions.".
(22) 	  Provisions common to a downgrade by a Rating Agency: Insert a new Section 18 of this Agreement immediately after Section 17 as follows:
"18 	  Common downgrade provisions
(a) 	  (Establishment and maintenance of Collateral Account): Where Party B has not established the Collateral Account for the Series Trust and Party A elects or is required to deliver collateral to Party B in accordance with the Credit Support Annex, the Manager must direct Party B to establish, as soon as is practicable, and maintain, in the name of Party B, an interest bearing account with an Eligible Bank which must be an account separate from the Collections Account for the Series Trust ("Collateral Account "). If Party B becomes aware that the Collateral Account for the Series Trust is held with an entity which is not an Eligible Bank, Party B must promptly establish a new interest bearing account with an Eligible Bank and transfer the balance of the former Collateral Account for the Series Trust to the new Collateral Account for the Series Trust within 30 days.
(b) 	  (Collateral transferred into Collateral Account): Any cash collateral delivered by Party A to Party B in accordance with the Credit Support Annex in compliance with its obligations under Section 16 or Section 17 and any cash proceeds (from disposal or otherwise) from any securities delivered by
Party A to Party B in accordance with the Credit Support Annex in compliance with its obligations under Section 16 or Section 17 (such cash, "Cash Collateral ") must be deposited into the Collateral Account and such Cash Collateral will not be subject to or applied according to the Series Supplement in respect of the Series Trust. No money must be paid into the Collateral Account other than Cash Collateral and interest payable on the money credited to the Collateral Account.
(c) 	  (Application of Collateral): Party B may only make withdrawals from any Collateral Account if directed to do so by the Manager and then only for the purpose of:
(i) 	  delivering to Party A Return Amounts, Interest Amounts or Equivalent Distributions in accordance with a Credit Support Annex;
(ii) 	  withdrawing any amount which has been incorrectly deposited into the Collateral Account (and the Manager agrees to direct Party B to refund or pay to Party A, and Party B agrees promptly to refund or pay to Party A, any such incorrectly deposited amount);
(iii) 	  paying bank accounts debit tax or any other similar Tax payable in respect of the Cash Collateral; or
(iv) 	  paying any amount due to be paid by Party A under this Agreement if Party A has not paid such amount when required (after taking into account any applicable grace period).
The parties acknowledge and agree that clause 5 of the General Security Deed applies to the Collateral Account.
Any amount withdrawn from the Collateral Account and applied in accordance with Section 18(c)(iii) or Section 18(c)(iv) above will (despite any inconsistency with the Credit Support Annex) be taken to reduce (by an amount equal to that amount withdrawn and applied) the Credit Support Balance under the Credit Support Annex. Any such reduction shall be allocated pro-rata between the Credit Support Balance under each of the Fitch Credit Support Annex and the Moody's Credit Support Annex (as applicable).
(d) 	  (Novation): If Party A arranges for the novation of all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement:
(i) 	  to a Fitch Eligible Replacement pursuant to Section 16(a)(iii)(A) or Section 16(b)(ii)(A) above; or
(ii) 	  to a Moody's Eligible Replacement pursuant to Section 17(a)(iii)(A) or Section 17(b)(iii)(A) above,
Party B (at the direction of the Manager) and the Manager will do all things necessary, at the cost of Party A, to effect such novation.
(e) 	  Multiple Credit Support Annexes
(i) 	  The parties agree that each Credit Support Annex:
(A) 	  forms part of this Schedule, the Master Agreement and this Agreement; and
(B) 	  constitutes a separate Transaction under this Agreement.
(ii) 	  Accordingly, separate calculations, payments and deliveries are to be made in respect of each Credit Support Annex. However, in order to avoid possible duplication of obligations to deliver credit support, the parties agree that any Delivery Amount or any Return Amount in respect of a Valuation Date calculated under a Credit Support Annex will take into account the following:
(A) 	  the Value of the Transferor's Credit Support Balance is to include the Value of Other Eligible Credit Support as of that Valuation Date provided that the maximum Return Amount which may be calculated under that Credit Support Annex on that Valuation Date is equal to the Value as of that Valuation Date of the Transferor's Credit Support Balance (without including the Value of any Other Eligible Credit Support); and
(B) 	  the Value of the Transferor's Credit Support Balance is to be adjusted to include any Delivery Amount and to deduct any Return Amount:
(1) 	  which has been calculated under any other Credit Support Annex or which is to be calculated under any other Credit Support Annex on such Valuation Date; and
(2) 	  the transfer of which, in either case, has not yet been completed and for which the relevant Settlement Day falls on or after such Valuation Date,
but only to the extent of the Value (if any) which would be calculated under that Credit Support Annex for the Eligible Credit Support or Equivalent Credit Support constituting that Delivery Amount or Return Amount.
(iii) 	  Party A will not be required to transfer more Eligible Credit Support than the greatest amount calculated in accordance each Credit Support Annex.
(iv) 	  "Other Eligible Credit Support " means, in respect of a Credit Support Annex, any credit support which would satisfy the description of Eligible Credit Support under that Credit Support Annex and which is comprised in the Credit Support Balance under any other Credit Support Annex.
(v) 	  The "Value " of any Other Eligible Credit Support in respect of a Credit Support Annex will be calculated in accordance with the provisions of that Credit Support Annex (subject to paragraph (vi) below), and not the Credit Support Annex under which the Other Eligible Credit Support has been provided.
(vi) 	  The parties agree that if a date is a Valuation Date under more than one Credit Support Annex then the calculations of Delivery Amounts and Return Amounts under each such Credit Support Annex are to be made consecutively with Party A selecting under which Credit
Support Annex the calculations are to be made first (so that the calculations under the second Credit Support Annex will take into account the result of the calculations made under the first Credit Support Annex). However, the calculations of Delivery Amounts and Return Amounts under a Credit Support Annex having a zero Credit Support Amount must be made before calculations under any other Credit Support Annex.".
(23) 	  Amendment to this Agreement:
(a) 	  The Manager must give 5 Business Days' notice in writing to each Rating Agency of any amendments to this Agreement.
(b) 	  This Agreement may be amended only by written agreement between all parties to this Agreement, provided that the Manager and Party B may only agree to such amendment in accordance with the provisions of clause 25 of the Master Trust Deed and for this purpose references in that clause to a Series Supplement will be taken to be references to this Agreement.
(24) 	  Appointment of Manager: Party B hereby exclusively appoints the Manager as its attorney to act on Party B's behalf and exercise all rights and powers of Party B with respect to this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Manager may issue and receive on behalf of Party B all notices, certificates and other communications to or by Party A under this Agreement until such time as Party B serves written notice on Party A of the revocation of the Manager's authority to act on behalf of Party B in accordance with this Part 5(24). The Manager hereby accepts such appointment. Party A is not obliged to enquire into the authority of the Manager to exercise or satisfy any of Party B's rights or obligations on Party B's behalf.
(25) 	  Hedge Agreement and Prepayment: The parties acknowledge and agree for the purposes of:
(a) 	  the Transaction Documents, this Agreement is a Currency Swap Agreement and a Support Facility and Party A is a Currency Swap Provider for the purposes of the Security Trust Deed and the General Security Deed; and
(b) 	  the Master Trust Deed, this Agreement is a Hedge Agreement.
(26) 	  No Amendment: Each of Party B and the Manager agrees that it will not consent to any amendment to any provision in any Transaction Document dealing with the ranking, priority or entitlement of Party A in respect of any security or moneys relating to the Series Trust without the prior written consent of Party A.
(27) 	  Manager as Party: For the purposes of Sections 2, 5, 6 and 10 the Manager is not a "party".
(28) 	  Anti-money laundering: Each party (the " Information Provider") agrees to provide any information and documents reasonably required by any other party (the " Information Recipient") to comply with any applicable anti-money laundering or counter-terrorism financing laws including, without limitation, any applicable laws imposing "know your customer" or other identification checks or procedures that the Information Recipient is required to comply with in respect of this Agreement (" AML/CTF Laws"), but the foregoing obligation applies only to the extent that such information and such documents are in the possession of the Information Provider or may be obtained by it after having undertaken reasonable steps and subject to any confidentiality, privacy or general law obligations owed by the Information Provider to any person in relation to whom the information or documents requested relate (except, in all cases, to the extent that the foregoing may be overridden by the relevant AML/CTF Laws). Each party must comply with any AML/CTF Laws applicable to it, to the extent required to comply with its obligations under the Transaction Documents. Any
party may decline to perform any obligation under the Transaction Documents to the extent it forms the view, in its reasonable opinion, that notwithstanding that it has taken all action to comply with any applicable AML/CTF Laws, it is required to decline to perform those obligations under any such AML/CTF Laws. To the maximum extent permitted by law, each party and the Noteholders and Unitholders releases each other party (a "Released Party ") from any confidentiality, privacy or general law obligations that a Released Party would otherwise owe to it in respect of this Agreement and to the extent to which it is able, any applicable confidentiality and privacy laws, but only to the extent that the existence of these obligations or laws would otherwise prevent a Released Party from providing any information or documents requested in accordance with this clause or any similar clause in any other Transaction Document.

(b) 	  If at any time during which Macquarie Leasing Pty Limited is required to file Exchange Act Reports, the Manager determines, reasonably and in good faith, that the significance percentage of this Agreement calculated in accordance with Item 1115 of Regulation AB has become less than 20% or less than 10%, the Manager shall notify Party A of that fact no later than ten (10) New York business days after such determination has been made.

Thereafter, the Manager shall inform Party A no later than ten (10) Local Business Days following such time as (i) the Manager has determined that Exchange Act Reports are no longer required to be filed in respect of the Relevant Notes pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Securities Act or (ii) Swap Financial Disclosure is no longer required to be included or incorporated by reference in such Exchange Act Reports.
(c) 	  So long as the Exchange Act Reports are required to be filed by Macquarie Leasing Pty Limited under the Exchange Act and Swap Financial Disclosure is required to be included or incorporated by reference in the Exchange Act Reports pursuant to Item 1115(b)(2) or Item 1115(b)(1), as applicable, of Regulation AB, Party A, at its own expense, shall within four (4) Local Business Days after receipt of a Swap Financial Disclosure Request, provide Party B and the Manager with the relevant Swap Financial Disclosure described in Part 5(29)(b) of this Schedule.

(ii) 	  any omission or alleged omission to state in the Swap Financial Disclosure provided by Party A a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or

(g) 	  Party B and Macquarie Leasing Pty Limited shall, jointly and severally, indemnify Party A, the present and former directors, officers, employees and agents of Party A and each person, if any, who controls Party A within the meaning of Section 15 of

(30) 	  Reporting
If not the reporting party with respect to the Transactions hereunder pursuant to the United States Commodity Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, Party A agrees that it shall cooperate with Party B in providing such documents, valuations and other information as are reasonably requested by Party B (acting on the direction of the Manager) in order to file or cause to be filed all reports required pursuant to Section 2(h)(5) of the United States Commodity Exchange Act and any rules and regulations thereunder on a timely basis, and as
otherwise are required to be made with respect to the Transactions hereunder under such Act and any rules and regulations thereunder on a timely basis.
(31) 	  Withholding Tax imposed on payments to non-US counterparties under the United States Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act: The parties agree that "Tax" as used in Part 2(a) of this Schedule (Payer Tax Representation) and "Indemnifiable Tax" as defined in Section 14 of this Agreement shall not include any U.S. federal withholding tax imposed or collected pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code "), any current or future regulations or official interpretations thereof, any agreement entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b) of the Code, or any fiscal or regulatory legislation, rules or practices adopted pursuant to any intergovernmental agreement entered into in connection with the implementation of such Sections of the Code (a "FATCA Withholding Tax ").

" Security Trust Deed" means the Master Security Trust Deed dated 27 February 2007 between Party B, the Manager, the Security Trustee and the Relevant Note Trustee, as amended.
" Series Supplement" means the SMART ABS Series 2015-3US Trust Series Supplement dated [l] 2015 between Party B, the Manager, Macquarie Leasing Pty Limited and Macquarie Bank Limited.
" Unpaid Floating Amount" in relation to a Monthly Floating Rate Payer Payment Date means the aggregate amount of the Monthly Floating Amounts calculated under paragraphs 5.1(A) and (B) with respect to each preceding Monthly Floating Rate Payer Payment Date which have not been paid by Party A on any Monthly Floating Rate Payer Payment Date preceding that Monthly Floating Rate Payer Payment Date in reliance on paragraph 5.3.
" USD-LIBOR-ICE" for an Interest Period will be calculated by the Agent Bank in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b), as applicable, below.
(a) 	 on the second London/New York Business Day before the beginning of the Interest Period (a "US$ Floating Rate Set Date ") the Agent Bank will determine the rate "USD-LIBOR-ICE", as the applicable Floating Rate Option , as being the rate applicable to any Interest Period for one month deposits in US$ in the London inter bank market which appears on the Rate Page at approximately 11.45am (London time) on the US$ Floating Rate Set Date; and
(b) 	 if the rate referred to in paragraph (a) does not appear on the Rate Page on the relevant US$ Floating Rate Set Date, the USD-LIBOR-ICE for that Interest Period will be determined as if the Issuer Trustee and the Agent Bank had specified "USD-LIBOR-Reference Banks", as the applicable Floating Rate Option. For this purpose "USD-LIBOR-Reference Banks " means that the rate for an Interest Period will be determined on the basis of the rates at which deposits in US$ are offered by the Reference Banks (being four major banks in the London interbank market determined by the Agent Bank) at approximately 11.00am, London time, on the US$ Floating Rate Set Date to prime banks in the London interbank market for a period of one month commencing on the first day of the Interest Period and in a Representative Amount (as defined in the 2006 ISDA Definitions of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc.). The Agent Bank will request the principal London office of each of the Reference Banks to provide a quotation of its rate. If at least two such quotations are provided, the USD-LIBOR-ICE for that Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations. If fewer than two quotations are provided as requested, the USD-LIBOR-ICE for that Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted by not less than two major banks in New York City, selected by the Agent Bank, at approximately 11.00am, New York City time, on that US$ Floating Rate Set Date for loans in US$ to leading European banks for a period of one month commencing on the first day of the Interest Period and in a Representative Amount. If no such rates are available in New York City, then the USD-LIBOR-ICE for such Interest Period will be the most recently determined rate in accordance with paragraph (a).
" US$ Equivalent" has the meaning given to that term in the Series Supplement.
Terms defined in the Note Conditions have the same meaning in this Confirmation unless otherwise defined in this Confirmation.

This Annex supplements, forms part of, and is subject to, the ISDA Master Agreement referred to above and is part of its Schedule. For the purposes of this Agreement, including, without limitation, Sections 1(c), 2(a), 5 and 6, the credit support arrangements set out in this Annex constitute a Transaction (for which this Annex constitutes the Confirmation).
Paragraph 1. Interpretation
Capitalised terms not otherwise defined in this Annex or elsewhere in this Agreement have the meanings specified pursuant to Paragraph 10, and all references in this Annex to Paragraphs are to Paragraphs of this Annex. In the event of any inconsistency between this Annex and the other provisions of this Schedule, this Annex will prevail, and in the event of any inconsistency between Paragraph 11 and the other
1    This document is not intended to create a charge or other security interest over the assets transferred under its terms. Persons intending to establish a collateral arrangement based on the creation of a charge or other security interest should consider using the ISDA Credit Support Deed (English law) or the ISDA Credit Support Annex (New York law), as appropriate.
2    This Credit Support Annex has been prepared for use with ISDA Master Agreements subject to English law.

provisions of this Annex, Paragraph 11 will prevail. For the avoidance of doubt, references to "transfer" in this Annex mean, in relation to cash, payment and, in relation to other assets, delivery.
Paragraph  2\. Credit Support Obligations
(a)        Delivery Amount. Subject to Paragraphs 3 and 4, upon a demand made by the Transferee on or promptly following a Valuation Date, if the Delivery Amount for that Valuation Date equals or exceeds the Transferor's Minimum Transfer Amount, then the Transferor will transfer to the Transferee Eligible Credit Support having a Value as of the date of transfer at least equal to the applicable Delivery Amount (rounded pursuant to Paragraph 11(b)(iii)(D)). Unless otherwise specified in Paragraph 11(b), the "Delivery Amount" applicable to the Transferor for any Valuation Date will equal the amount by which:
(i)       the Credit Support Amount
exceeds
(ii)      the Value as of that Valuation Date of the Transferor's Credit Support Balance (adjusted to include any prior Delivery Amount and to exclude any prior Return Amount, the transfer of which, in either case, has not yet been completed and for which the relevant Settlement Day falls on or after such Valuation Date).
(b)        Return Amount.     Subject to Paragraphs 3 and 4, upon a demand made by the Transferor on or promptly following a Valuation Date, if the Return Amount for that Valuation Date equals or exceeds the Transferee's Minimum Transfer Amount, then the Transferee will transfer to the Transferor Equivalent Credit Support specified by the Transferor in that demand having a Value as of the date of transfer as close as practicable to the applicable Return Amount (rounded pursuant to Paragraph 11(b)(iii)(D)) and the Credit Support Balance will, upon such transfer, be reduced accordingly. Unless otherwise specified in Paragraph 11(b), the "Return Amount" applicable to the Transferee for any Valuation Date will equal the amount by which:
(i)       the Value as of that Valuation Date of the Transferor's Credit Support Balance (adjusted to include any prior Delivery Amount and to exclude any prior Return Amount, the transfer of which, in either case, has not yet been completed and for which the relevant Settlement Day falls on or after such Valuation Date)
exceeds
(ii)      the Credit Support Amount.
Paragraph  3\. Transfers, Calculations and Exchanges
(a)        Transfers.       All transfers under this Annex of any Eligible Credit Support, Equivalent Credit Support, Interest Amount or Equivalent Distributions shall be made in accordance with the instructions of the Transferee or Transferor, as applicable, and shall be made:
(i)       in the case of cash, by transfer into one or more bank accounts specified by the recipient;
2 	    	 ISDA ® 1995
(ii)       in the case of certificated securities which cannot or which the parties have agreed will not be delivered by book-entry, by delivery in appropriate physical form to the recipient or its account accompanied by any duly executed instruments of transfer, transfer tax stamps and any other documents necessary to constitute a legally valid transfer of the transferring party's legal and beneficial title to the recipient; and
(iii)      in the case of securities which the parties have agreed will be delivered by book-entry, by the giving of written instructions (including, for the avoidance of doubt, instructions given by telex, facsimile transmission or electronic messaging system) to the relevant depository institution or other entity specified by the recipient, together with a written copy of the instructions to the recipient, sufficient, if complied with, to result in a legally effective transfer of the transferring party's legal and beneficial title to the recipient.
Subject to Paragraph 4 and unless otherwise specified, if a demand for the transfer of Eligible Credit Support or Equivalent Credit Support is received by the Notification Time, then the relevant transfer will be made not later than the close of business on the Settlement Day relating to the date such demand is received; if a demand is received after the Notification Time, then the relevant transfer will be made not later than the close of business on the Settlement Day relating to the day after the date such demand is received.
(b)        Calculations. All calculations of Value and Exposure for purposes of Paragraphs 2 and 4(a) will be made by the relevant Valuation Agent as of the relevant Valuation Time. The Valuation Agent will notify each party (or the other party, if the Valuation Agent is a party) of its calculations not later than the Notification Time on the Local Business Day following the applicable Valuation Date (or, in the case of Paragraph 4(a), following the date of calculation).
(c)        Exchanges.
(i)       Unless otherwise specified in Paragraph 11, the Transferor may on any Local Business Day by notice inform the Transferee that it wishes to transfer to the Transferee Eligible Credit Support specified in that notice (the "New Credit Support") in exchange for certain Eligible Credit Support (the "Original Credit Support") specified in that notice comprised in the Transferor's Credit Support Balance.
(ii)      If the Transferee notifies the Transferor that it has consented to the proposed exchange, (A) the Transferor will be obliged to transfer the New Credit Support to the Transferee on the first Settlement Day following the date on which it receives notice (which may be oral telephonic notice) from the Transferee of its consent and (B) the Transferee will be obliged to transfer to the Transferor Equivalent Credit Support in respect of the Original Credit Support not later than the Settlement Day following the date on which the Transferee receives the New Credit Support, unless otherwise specified in Paragraph 11(d) (the "Exchange Date"); provided that the Transferee will only be obliged to transfer Equivalent Credit Support with a Value as of the date of transfer as close as practicable to, but in any event not more than, the Value of the New Credit Support as of that date.
3 	    	 ISDA ® 1995
Paragraph 4.  Dispute Resolution
(a)        Disputed Calculations or Valuations. If a party (a "Disputing Party") reasonably disputes (I) the Valuation Agent's calculation of a Delivery Amount or a Return Amount or (II) the Value of any transfer of Eligible Credit Support or Equivalent Credit Support, then:
(1)        the Disputing Party will notify the other party and the Valuation Agent (if the Valuation Agent is not the other party) not later than the close of business on the Local Business Day following, in the case of (I) above, the date that the demand is received under Paragraph 2 or, in the case of (II) above, the date of transfer;
(2)        in the case of (I) above, the appropriate party will transfer the undisputed amount to the other party not later than the close of business on the Settlement Day following the date that the demand is received under Paragraph 2;
(3)        the parties will consult with each other in an attempt to resolve the dispute; and
(4)        if they fail to resolve the dispute by the Resolution Time, then:
(i)            in the case of a dispute involving a Delivery Amount or Return Amount, unless otherwise specified in Paragraph 11(c), the Valuation Agent will recalculate the Exposure and the Value as of the Recalculation Date by:
(A)       utilising any calculations of that part of the Exposure attributable to the Transactions that the parties have agreed are not in dispute;
(B)       calculating that part of the Exposure attributable to the Transactions in dispute by seeking four actual quotations at mid-market from Reference Market-makers for purposes of calculating Market Quotation, and taking the arithmetic average of those obtained; provided that if four quotations are not available for a particular Transaction, then fewer than four quotations may be used for that Transaction, and if no quotations are available for a particular Transaction, then the Valuation Agent's original calculations will be used for the Transaction; and
(C)       utilising the procedures specified in Paragraph 11(e)(ii) for calculating the Value, if disputed, of the outstanding Credit Support Balance;
(ii)    in the case of a dispute involving the Value of any transfer of Eligible Credit Support or Equivalent Credit Support, the Valuation Agent will recalculate the Value as of the date of transfer pursuant to Paragraph 11(e)(ii).
Following a recalculation pursuant to this Paragraph, the Valuation Agent will notify each party (or the other party, if the Valuation Agent is a party) as soon as possible but in any event not later than the Notification Time on the Local Business Day following the Resolution Time. The appropriate party will, upon demand following such notice given by the Valuation Agent or a resolution pursuant to (3) above and subject to Paragraph 3(a), make the appropriate transfer.
4 	    	 ISDA ® 1995
(b)          No Event of Default.    The failure by a party to make a transfer of any amount which is the subject of a dispute to which Paragraph 4(a) applies will not constitute an Event of Default for as long as the procedures set out in this Paragraph 4 are being carried out. For the avoidance of doubt, upon completion of those procedures, Section 5(a)(i) of this Agreement will apply to any failure by a party to make a transfer required under the final sentence of Paragraph 4(a) on the relevant due date.
Paragraph 5. Transfer of Title, No Security Interest, Distributions and Interest Amount
(a)              Transfer of Title.    Each party agrees that all right, title and interest in and to any Eligible Credit Support, Equivalent Credit Support, Equivalent Distributions or Interest Amount which it transfers to the other party under the terms of this Annex shall vest in the recipient free and clear of any liens, claims, charges or encumbrances or any other interest of the transferring party or of any third person (other than a lien routinely imposed on all securities in a relevant clearance system).
(b)           No Security Interest.   Nothing in this Annex is intended to create or does create in favour of either party any mortgage, charge, lien, pledge, encumbrance or other security interest in any cash or other property transferred by one party to the other party under the terms of this Annex.
(c)         Distributions and Interest Amount.
(i)        Distributions.   The Transferee will transfer to the Transferor not later than the Settlement Day following each Distributions Date cash, securities or other property of the same type, nominal value, description and amount as the relevant Distributions ("Equivalent Distributions") to the extent that a Delivery Amount would not be created or increased by the transfer, as calculated by the Valuation Agent (and the date of calculation will be deemed a Valuation Date for this purpose).
(ii)        Interest Amount.   Unless otherwise specified in Paragraph 11(f)(iii), the Transferee will transfer to the Transferor at the times specified in Paragraph 11(f)(ii) the relevant Interest Amount to the extent that a Delivery Amount would not be created or increased by the transfer, as calculated by the Valuation Agent (and the date of calculation will be deemed a Valuation Date for this purpose).
Paragraph 6. Default
If an Early Termination Date is designated or deemed to occur as a result of an Event of Default in relation to a party, an amount equal to the Value of the Credit Support Balance, determined as though the Early Termination Date were a Valuation Date, will be deemed to be an Unpaid Amount due to the Transferor (which may or may not be the Defaulting Party) for purposes of Section 6(e). For the avoidance of doubt, if Market Quotation is the applicable payment measure for purposes of Section 6(e), then the Market Quotation determined under Section 6(e) in relation to the Transaction constituted by this Annex will be deemed to be zero, and, if Loss is the applicable payment measure for purposes of Section 6(e), then the Loss determined under Section 6(e) in relation to the Transaction will be limited to the Unpaid Amount representing the Value of the Credit Support Balance.
5 	    	 ISDA ® 1995
Paragraph 7. Representation
Each party represents to the other party (which representation will be deemed to be repeated as of each date on which it transfers Eligible Credit Support, Equivalent Credit Support or Equivalent Distributions) that it is the sole owner of or otherwise has the right to transfer all Eligible Credit Support, Equivalent Credit Support or Equivalent Distributions it transfers to the other party under this Annex, free and clear of any security interest, lien, encumbrance or other restriction (other than a lien routinely imposed on all securities in a relevant clearance system).
Paragraph 8. Expenses
Each party will pay its own costs and expenses (including any stamp, transfer or similar transaction tax or duty payable on any transfer it is required to make under this Annex) in connection with performing its obligations under this Annex, and neither party will be liable for any such costs and expenses incurred by the other party.
Paragraph 9. Miscellaneous
(a)          Default Interest.      Other than in the case of an amount which is the subject of a dispute under Paragraph 4(a), if a Transferee fails to make, when due, any transfer of Equivalent Credit Support, Equivalent Distributions or the Interest Amount, it will be obliged to pay the Transferor (to the extent permitted under applicable law) an amount equal to interest at the Default Rate multiplied by the Value on the relevant Valuation Date of the items of property that were required to be transferred, from (and including) the date that the Equivalent Credit Support, Equivalent Distributions or Interest Amount were required to be transferred to (but excluding) the date of transfer of the Equivalent Credit Support, Equivalent Distributions or Interest Amount. This interest will be calculated on the basis of daily compounding and the actual number of days elapsed.
(b)          Good Faith and Commercially Reasonable Manner.
Performance of all obligations under this Annex, including, but not limited to, all calculations, valuations and determinations made by either party, will be made in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner.
(c)         Demands and Notices.       All demands and notices given by a party under this Annex will be given as specified in Section 12 of this Agreement.
(d)         Specifications of Certain Matters.        Anything referred to in this Annex as being specified in Paragraph 11 also may be specified in one or more Confirmations or other documents and this Annex will be construed accordingly.

For the purposes of this Agreement, including, without limitation, Sections 1(c), 2(a), 5 and 6, the credit support arrangements set out in this Annex constitute a Transaction (for which this Annex constitutes the Confirmation).
Paragraph 1.  Interpretation
Capitalised terms not otherwise defined in this Annex or elsewhere in this Agreement have the meanings specified pursuant to Paragraph 10, and all references in this Annex to Paragraphs are to Paragraphs of this Annex. In the event of any inconsistency between this Annex and the other provisions of this Schedule, this Annex will prevail, and in the event of any inconsistency between Paragraph 11 and the other
1    This document is not intended to create a charge or other security interest over the assets transferred under its terms. Persons intending to establish a collateral arrangement based on the creation of a charge or other security interest should consider using the ISDA Credit Support Deed (English law) or the ISDA Credit Support Annex (New York law), as appropriate.
2    This Credit Support Annex has been prepared for use with ISDA Master Agreements subject to English law. Users should consult their legal advisers as to the proper use and effect of this form and the arrangements it contemplates. In particular, users should consult their legal advisers if they wish to have the Credit Support Annex made subject to a governing law other than English law or to have the Credit Support Annex subject to a different governing law than that governing the rest of the ISDA Master Agreement (e.g., English law for the Credit Support Annex and New York law for the rest of the ISDA Master Agreement).

provisions of this Annex, Paragraph 11 will prevail. For the avoidance of doubt, references to "transfer" in this Annex mean, in relation to cash, payment and, in relation to other assets, delivery.
Paragraph 2.  Credit Support Obligations
(a)        Delivery Amount. Subject to Paragraphs 3 and 4, upon a demand made by the Transferee on or promptly following a Valuation Date, if the Delivery Amount for that Valuation Date equals or exceeds the Transferor's Minimum Transfer Amount, then the Transferor will transfer to the Transferee Eligible Credit Support having a Value as of the date of transfer at least equal to the applicable Delivery Amount (rounded pursuant to Paragraph 11(b)(iii)(D)). Unless otherwise specified in Paragraph 11(b), the "Delivery Amount" applicable to the Transferor for any Valuation Date will equal the amount by which:
(i)        the Credit Support Amount
exceeds
(ii)        the Value as of that Valuation Date of the Transferor's Credit Support Balance (adjusted to include any prior Delivery Amount and to exclude any prior Return Amount, the transfer of which, in either case, has not yet been completed and for which the relevant Settlement Day falls on or after such Valuation Date).
(b)       Return Amount.     Subject to Paragraphs 3 and 4, upon a demand made by the Transferor on or promptly following a Valuation Date, if the Return Amount for that Valuation Date equals or exceeds the Transferee's Minimum Transfer Amount, then the Transferee will transfer to the Transferor Equivalent Credit Support specified by the Transferor in that demand having a Value as of the date of transfer as close as practicable to the applicable Return Amount (rounded pursuant to Paragraph 11(b)(iii)(D)) and the Credit Support Balance will, upon such transfer, be reduced accordingly. Unless otherwise specified in Paragraph 11(b), the "Return Amount" applicable to the Transferee for any Valuation Date will equal the amount by which:
(i)        the Value as of that Valuation Date of the Transferor's Credit Support Balance (adjusted to include any prior Delivery Amount and to exclude any prior Return Amount, the transfer of which, in either case, has not yet been completed and for which the relevant Settlement Day falls on or after such Valuation Date)
exceeds
(ii)        the Credit Support Amount.
Paragraph  3\. Transfers, Calculations and Exchanges
(a)        Transfers.         All transfers under this Annex of any Eligible Credit Support, Equivalent Credit Support, Interest Amount or Equivalent Distributions shall be made in accordance with the instructions of the Transferee or Transferor, as applicable, and shall be made:
(i)         in the case of cash, by transfer into one or more bank accounts specified by the recipient;
2 	    	 ISDA ® 1995
(ii)       in the case of certificated securities which cannot or which the parties have agreed will not be delivered by book-entry, by delivery in appropriate physical form to the recipient or its account accompanied by any duly executed instruments of transfer, transfer tax stamps and any other documents necessary to constitute a legally valid transfer of the transferring party's legal and beneficial title to the recipient; and
(iii)      in the case of securities which the parties have agreed will be delivered by book-entry, by the giving of written instructions (including, for the avoidance of doubt, instructions given by telex, facsimile transmission or electronic messaging system) to the relevant depository institution or other entity specified by the recipient, together with a written copy of the instructions to the recipient, sufficient, if complied with, to result in a legally effective transfer of the transferring party's legal and beneficial title to the recipient.
Subject to Paragraph 4 and unless otherwise specified, if a demand for the transfer of Eligible Credit Support or Equivalent Credit Support is received by the Notification Time, then the relevant transfer will be made not later than the close of business on the Settlement Day relating to the date such demand is received; if a demand is received after the Notification Time, then the relevant transfer will be made not later than the close of business on the Settlement Day relating to the day after the date such demand is received.
(b)         Calculations. All calculations of Value and Exposure for purposes of Paragraphs 2 and 4(a) will be made by the relevant Valuation Agent as of the relevant Valuation Time. The Valuation Agent will notify each party (or the other party, if the Valuation Agent is a party) of its calculations not later than the Notification Time on the Local Business Day following the applicable Valuation Date (or, in the case of Paragraph 4(a), following the date of calculation).
(c)         Exchanges.
(i)        Unless otherwise specified in Paragraph 11, the Transferor may on any Local Business Day by notice inform the Transferee that it wishes to transfer to the Transferee Eligible Credit Support specified in that notice (the "New Credit Support") in exchange for certain Eligible Credit Support (the "Original Credit Support") specified in that notice comprised in the Transferor's Credit Support Balance.
(ii)        If the Transferee notifies the Transferor that it has consented to the proposed exchange, (A) the Transferor will be obliged to transfer the New Credit Support to the Transferee on the first Settlement Day following the date on which it receives notice (which may be oral telephonic notice) from the Transferee of its consent and (B) the Transferee will be obliged to transfer to the Transferor Equivalent Credit Support in respect of the Original Credit Support not later than the Settlement Day following the date on which the Transferee receives the New Credit Support, unless otherwise specified in Paragraph 11(d) (the "Exchange Date"); provided that the Transferee will only be obliged to transfer Equivalent Credit Support with a Value as of the date of transfer as close as practicable to, but in any event not more than, the Value of the New Credit Support as of that date.
3 	    	 ISDA ® 1995
Paragraph 4.  Dispute Resolution
(a)        Disputed Calculations or Valuations. If a party (a "Disputing Party") reasonably disputes (I) the Valuation Agent's calculation of a Delivery Amount or a Return Amount or (II) the Value of any transfer of Eligible Credit Support or Equivalent Credit Support, then:
(1)        the Disputing Party will notify the other party and the Valuation Agent (if the Valuation Agent is not the other party) not later than the close of business on the Local Business Day following, in the case of (I) above, the date that the demand is received under Paragraph 2 or, in the case of (II) above, the date of transfer;
(2)        in the case of (I) above, the appropriate party will transfer the undisputed amount to the other party not later than the close of business on the Settlement Day following the date that the demand is received under Paragraph 2;
(3)        the parties will consult with each other in an attempt to resolve the dispute; and
(4)        if they fail to resolve the dispute by the Resolution Time, then:
(i)            in the case of a dispute involving a Delivery Amount or Return Amount, unless otherwise specified in Paragraph 11(c), the Valuation Agent will recalculate the Exposure and the Value as of the Recalculation Date by:
(A)       utilising any calculations of that part of the Exposure attributable to the Transactions that the parties have agreed are not in dispute;
(B)       calculating that part of the Exposure attributable to the Transactions in dispute by seeking four actual quotations at mid-market from Reference Market-makers for purposes of calculating Market Quotation, and taking the arithmetic average of those obtained; provided that if four quotations are not available for a particular Transaction, then fewer than four quotations may be used for that Transaction, and if no quotations are available for a particular Transaction, then the Valuation Agent's original calculations will be used for the Transaction; and
(C)       utilising the procedures specified in Paragraph 11(e)(ii) for calculating the Value, if disputed, of the outstanding Credit Support Balance;
(ii)     in the case of a dispute involving the Value of any transfer of Eligible Credit Support or Equivalent Credit Support, the Valuation Agent will recalculate the Value as of the date of transfer pursuant to Paragraph 11(e)(ii).
Following a recalculation pursuant to this Paragraph, the Valuation Agent will notify each party (or the other party, if the Valuation Agent is a party) as soon as possible but in any event not later than the Notification Time on the Local Business Day following the Resolution Time. The appropriate party will, upon demand following such notice given by the Valuation Agent or a resolution pursuant to (3) above and subject to Paragraph 3(a), make the appropriate transfer.
4 	    	 ISDA ® 1995
(b)        No Event of Default.   The failure by a party to make a transfer of any amount which is the subject of a dispute to which Paragraph 4(a) applies will not constitute an Event of Default for as long as the procedures set out in this Paragraph 4 are being carried out. For the avoidance of doubt, upon completion of those procedures, Section 5(a)(i) of this Agreement will apply to any failure by a party to make a transfer required under the final sentence of Paragraph 4(a) on the relevant due date.
Paragraph 5.  Transfer of Title, No Security Interest, Distributions and Interest Amount
(a)        Transfer of Title.     Each party agrees that all right, title and interest in and to any Eligible Credit Support, Equivalent Credit Support, Equivalent Distributions or Interest Amount which it transfers to the other party under the terms of this Annex shall vest in the recipient free and clear of any liens, claims, charges or encumbrances or any other interest of the transferring party or of any third person (other than a lien routinely imposed on all securities in a relevant clearance system).
(b)        No Security Interest.   Nothing in this Annex is intended to create or does create in favour of either party any mortgage, charge, lien, pledge, encumbrance or other security interest in any cash or other property transferred by one party to the other party under the terms of this Annex.
(c)        Distributions and Interest Amount.
(i)       Distributions.   The Transferee will transfer to the Transferor not later than the Settlement Day following each Distributions Date cash, securities or other property of the same type, nominal value, description and amount as the relevant Distributions ("Equivalent Distributions") to the extent that a Delivery Amount would not be created or increased by the transfer, as calculated by the Valuation Agent (and the date of calculation will be deemed a Valuation Date for this purpose).
(ii)       Interest Amount.   Unless otherwise specified in Paragraph 11(f)(iii), the Transferee will transfer to the Transferor at the times specified in Paragraph 11(f)(ii) the relevant Interest Amount to the extent that a Delivery Amount would not be created or increased by the transfer, as calculated by the Valuation Agent (and the date of calculation will be deemed a Valuation Date for this purpose).
Paragraph  6\. Default
If an Early Termination Date is designated or deemed to occur as a result of an Event of Default in relation to a party, an amount equal to the Value of the Credit Support Balance, determined as though the Early Termination Date were a Valuation Date, will be deemed to be an Unpaid Amount due to the Transferor (which may or may not be the Defaulting Party) for purposes of Section 6(e). For the avoidance of doubt, if Market Quotation is the applicable payment measure for purposes of Section 6(e), then the Market Quotation determined under Section 6(e) in relation to the Transaction constituted by this Annex will be deemed to be zero, and, if Loss is the applicable payment measure for purposes of Section 6(e), then the Loss determined under Section 6(e) in relation to the Transaction will be limited to the Unpaid Amount representing the Value of the Credit Support Balance.
5 	    	 ISDA ® 1995
Paragraph 7.  Representation
Each party represents to the other party (which representation will be deemed to be repeated as of each date on which it transfers Eligible Credit Support, Equivalent Credit Support or Equivalent Distributions) that it is the sole owner of or otherwise has the right to transfer all Eligible Credit Support, Equivalent Credit Support or Equivalent Distributions it transfers to the other party under this Annex, free and clear of any security interest, lien, encumbrance or other restriction (other than a lien routinely imposed on all securities in a relevant clearance system).
Paragraph 8.  Expenses
Each party will pay its own costs and expenses (including any stamp, transfer or similar transaction tax or duty payable on any transfer it is required to make under this Annex) in connection with performing its obligations under this Annex, and neither party will be liable for any such costs and expenses incurred by the other party.
Paragraph 9.  Miscellaneous
(a)        Default Interest .     Other than in the case of an amount which is the subject of a dispute under Paragraph 4(a), if a Transferee fails to make, when due, any transfer of Equivalent Credit Support, Equivalent Distributions or the Interest Amount, it will be obliged to pay the Transferor (to the extent permitted under applicable law) an amount equal to interest at the Default Rate multiplied by the Value on the relevant Valuation Date of the items of property that were required to be transferred, from (and including) the date that the Equivalent Credit Support, Equivalent Distributions or Interest Amount were required to be transferred to (but excluding) the date of transfer of the Equivalent Credit Support, Equivalent Distributions or Interest Amount. This interest will be calculated on the basis of daily compounding and the actual number of days elapsed.
(b)        Good Faith and Commercially Reasonable Manner.
Performance of all obligations under this Annex, including, but not limited to, all calculations, valuations and determinations made by either party, will be made in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner.

(b) 	  if the rate referred to in paragraph (a) does not appear on the Rate Page on the relevant US$ Floating Rate Set Date, the USD-LIBOR-ICE for that Interest Period will be determined as if the Issuer Trustee and the Agent Bank had specified "USD-LIBOR-Reference Banks", as the applicable Floating Rate Option. For this purpose "USD-LIBOR-Reference Banks " means that the rate for an Interest Period will be determined on the basis of the rates at which deposits in US$ are offered by the Reference Banks (being four major banks in the London interbank market determined by the Agent Bank) at approximately 11.00am, London time, on the US$ Floating Rate Set Date to prime banks in the London interbank market for a period of one month commencing on the first day of the Interest Period and in a Representative Amount (as defined in the 2006 ISDA Definitions of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc.). The Agent Bank will request the principal London office of each of the Reference Banks to provide a quotation of its rate. If at least two such quotations are provided, the USD-LIBOR-ICE for that Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations. If fewer than two quotations are provided as requested, the USD-LIBOR-ICE for that Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted by not less than two major banks in New York City, selected by the Agent Bank, at approximately 11.00am, New York City time, on that US$ Floating Rate Set Date for loans in US$ to leading European banks for a period of one month commencing on the first day of the Interest Period and in a Representative Amount. If no such rates are available in New York City, then the USD-LIBOR-ICE for such Interest Period will be the most recently determined rate in accordance with paragraph (a).
" US$ Equivalent" has the meaning given to that term in the Series Supplement.
Terms defined in the Note Conditions have the same meaning in this Confirmation unless otherwise defined in this Confirmation.
