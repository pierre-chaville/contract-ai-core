dated as of October 27, 2008
and BRANCH BANKING AND TRUST COMPANY 	   	  	    	  ROANOKE GAS COMPANY ("Party A") 	   	  	    	 ("Party B")
have entered and/or anticipate entering into one or more transactions (each a "Transaction") that are or will be governed by this Master Agreement, which includes the schedule (the "Schedule"), and the documents and other confirming evidence (each a "Confirmation") exchanged between the parties confirming those Transactions.
Accordingly, the parties agree as follows:--
1. 	 Interpretation
(a) 	 Definitions . The terms defined in Section 12 and in the Schedule will have the meanings therein specified for the purpose of this Master Agreement.
(b) 	 Inconsistency . In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of the Schedule and the other provisions of this Master Agreement, the Schedule will prevail. In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of any Confirmation and this Master Agreement (including the Schedule), such Confirmation will prevail for the purpose of the relevant Transaction.
(c) 	 Single Agreement . All Transactions are entered into in reliance on the fact that this Master Agreement and all Confirmations form a single agreement between the parties (collectively referred to as this "Agreement"), and the parties would not otherwise enter into any Transactions.
2. 	 Obligations
(a) 	 General Conditions .
(i) 	 Each party will make each payment or delivery specified in each Confirmation to be made by it, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement.
(ii) 	  Payments under this Agreement will be made on the due date for value on that date in the place of the account specified in the relevant Confirmation or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement, in freely transferable funds and in the manner customary for payments in the required currency. Where settlement is by delivery (that is, other than by payment), such

delivery will be made for receipt on the due date in the manner customary for the relevant obligation unless otherwise specified in the relevant Confirmation or elsewhere in this Agreement.
(iii) 	 Each obligation of each party under Section 2(a)(i) is subject to (1) the condition precedent that no Event of Default or Potential Event of Default with respect to the other party has occurred and is continuing, (2) the condition precedent that no Early Termination Date in respect of the relevant Transaction has occurred or been effectively designated and (3) each other applicable condition precedent specified in this Agreement.
(b) 	 Change of Account . Either party may change its account for receiving a payment or delivery by giving notice to the other party at least five Local Business Days prior to the scheduled date for the payment or delivery to which such change applies unless such other party gives timely notice of a reasonable objection to such change.
(c) 	 Netting . If on any date amounts would otherwise be payable:
(i) 	 in the same currency; and
(ii) 	 in respect of the same Transaction,
by each party to the other, then, on such date, each party's obligation to make payment of any such amount will be automatically satisfied and discharged and, if the aggregate amount that would otherwise have been payable by one party exceeds the aggregate amount that would otherwise have been payable by the other party, replaced by an obligation upon the party by whom the larger aggregate amount would have been payable to pay to the other party the excess of the larger aggregate amount over the smaller aggregate amount.
The parties may elect in respect of two or more Transactions that a net amount will be determined in respect of all amounts payable on the same date in the same currency in respect of such Transactions, regardless of whether such amounts are payable in respect of the same Transaction. The election may be made in the Schedule or a Confirmation by specifying that subparagraph (ii) above will not apply to the Transactions identified as being subject to the election, together with the starting date (in which case subparagraph (ii) above will not, or will cease to, apply to such Transactions from such date).
This election may be made separately for different groups of Transactions and will apply separately to each pairing of branches or offices through which the parties make and receive payments or deliveries.
(d) 	 Default interest; Other Amounts. Prior to the occurrence or effective designation of an Early Termination Date in respect of the relevant Transaction, a party that defaults in the performance of any payment obligation will, to the extent permitted by law and subject to Section (6c), be required to pay interest (before as well as after judgment) on the overdue amount to the other party on demand in the same currency as such overdue amount, for the period from (and including) the original due date for payment to (but excluding) the date of actual payment, at the Default Rate. Such interest will be calculated on the basis of daily compounding and the actual number of days elapsed. If, prior to the occurrence or effective designation of an Early Termination Date in respect of the relevant Transaction, a party defaults in the performance of any obligation required to be settled by delivery, it will compensate the other party on demand if and to the extent provided for in the relevant Confirmation or elsewhere in this Agreement.
3. 	 Representations
Each party represents to the other party (which representations will be deemed to be repeated by each party on each date on which a Transaction is entered into) that:--

5 	   	 ISDA ® 1992 Second Printing
(b) 	 Termination Events. The occurrence at any time with respect to a party or, if applicable, any Credit Support Provider of such party or any Specified Entity of such party of any event specified below constitutes an Illegality if the event is specified in (i) below, and, if specified to be applicable, a Credit Event Upon Merger if the event is specified pursuant to (ii) below or an Additional Termination Event if the event is specified pursuant to (iii) below:
(i) 	 Illegality. Due to the adoption of, or any change in, any applicable law after the date on which a Transaction is entered into, or due to the promulgation of, or any change in, the interpretation by any court, tribunal or regulatory authority with competent jurisdiction of any applicable law after such date, it becomes unlawful (other than as a result of a breach by the party of Section 4(b)) for such party (which will be the Affected Party):
(1) 	 to perform any absolute or contingent obligation to make a payment or delivery or to receive a payment or delivery in respect of such Transaction or to comply with any other material provision of this Agreement relating to such Transaction; or
(2) 	 to perform, or for any Credit Support Provider of such party to perform, any contingent or other obligation which the party (or such Credit Support Provider) has under any Credit Support Document relating to such Transaction;
(ii) 	 Credit Event Upon Merger. If "Credit Event Upon Merger" is specified in the Schedule as applying to the party, such party ("X"), any Credit Support Provider of X or any applicable Specified Entity of X consolidates or amalgamates with, or merges with or into, or transfers all or substantially all its assets to, another entity and such action does not constitute an event described in Section 5(a)(viii) but the creditworthiness of the resulting, surviving or transferee entity is materially weaker than that of X, such Credit Support Provider or such Specified Entity, as the case may be, immediately prior to such action (and, in such event, X or its successor or transferee, as appropriate, will be the Affected Party); or
(iii) 	 Additional Termination Event. If any "Additional Termination Event" is specified in the Schedule or any Confirmation as applying, the occurrence of such event (and, in such event, the Affected Party or Affected Parties shall be as specified for such Additional Termination Event in the Schedule or such Confirmation).
(c) 	 Event of Default and Illegality. If an event or circumstance which would otherwise constitute or give rise to an Event of Default also constitutes an Illegality, it will be treated as an Illegality and will not constitute an Event of Default.
6. 	 Early Termination
(a) 	 Right to Terminate Following Event of Default.If at any time an Event of Default with respect to a party (the "Defaulting Party") has occurred and is then continuing, the other party (the "Non-defaulting Party") may, by not more than 20 days notice to the Defaulting Party specifying the relevant Event of Default, designate a day not earlier than the day such notice is effective as an Early Termination Date in respect of all outstanding Transactions. If, however, "Automatic Early Termination" is specified in the Schedule as applying to a party, then an Early Termination Date in respect of all outstanding Transactions will occur immediately upon the occurrence with respect to such party of an Event of Default specified in Section 5(a)(vii)(1), (3), (5), (6) or, to the extent analogous thereto, (8), and as of the time immediately preceding the institution of the relevant proceeding or the presentation of the relevant petition upon the occurrence with respect to such part of an Event of Default specified in Section 5(a)(vii)(4) or, to the extent analogous thereto, (8).
6 	   	 ISDA ® 1992 Second Printing
(b) 	 Right to Terminate Following Termination Event.
(i) 	 Notice. If a Termination Event occurs, an Affected Party will, promptly upon becoming aware of it, notify the other party, specifying the nature of that Termination Event and each Affected Transaction and will also give such other information about the Termination Event as the other party may reasonably require.
(ii) 	 Two Affected Parties. If an Illegality under Section 5(b)(i)(1) occurs and there are two Affected Parties, each party will use all reasonable efforts to reach agreement within 30 days after notice thereof is given under Section 6(b)(i) on action to avoid that Termination Event.
(iii) 	 Right to Terminate. If:
(1) 	 an agreement under Section 6(b)(ii) has not be effected with respect to all Affected Transactions within 30 days after an Affected Party gives notice under Section 6(b)(i); or
(2) 	 an Illegality other than that referred to in 6(b)(ii), a Credit Event Upon Merger or an Additional Termination Event occurs,
either party in the case of Illegality, an Affected Party in the case of an Additional Termination Event if there is more than one Affected Party, or the party which is not the Affected Party in the case of a Credit Event Upon Merger or an Additional Termination Event if there is only one Affected Party may, by not more than 20 days notice to the other party and provided that the relevant Termination Event is then continuing, designate a day not earlier than the day such notice is effective as an Early Termination Date in respect of all Affected Transactions.
(c) 	 Effect of Designation.
(i) 	 If notice designating an Early Termination Date is given under Section 6(a) or (b), the Early Termination Date will occur on the date so designated, whether or not the relevant Event of Default or Termination Event is then continuing.
(ii) 	 Upon the occurrence or effective designation of an Early Termination Date, no further payments or deliveries under Section 2(a)(i) or 2(d) in respect of the Terminated Transactions will be required to be made, but without prejudice to the other provisions of this Agreement. The amount, if any, payable in respect of an Early Termination Date shall be determined pursuant to Section 6(e).
(d) 	 Calculations.
(i) 	 Statement.On or as soon as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of an Early Termination Date, each party will make the calculations on its part, if any, contemplated by Section  6(e) and will provide to the other party a statement (1) showing, in reasonable detail, such calculations (including all relevant quotations and specifying any amount payable under Section 6(e)) and (2) giving details of the relevant account to which any amount payable to it is to be paid. In the absence of written confirmation from the source of a quotation obtained in determining a Market Quotation, the records of the party obtaining such quotation will be conclusive evidence of the existence and accuracy of such quotation.
(ii) 	 Payment Date.An amount calculated as being due in respect of any Early Termination Date under Section  6(e) will be payable on the day that notice of the amount payable is effective (in the case of an Early Termination Date, which is designated or occurs as a result of an Event of Default) and on the day which is two Local Business Days after the day on which notice of the amount payable is effective (in the case of an Early Termination Date which is designated as a result of a Termination Event). Such amount will be paid together with (to the extent permitted under applicable law) interest thereon (before as well as after judgement), from (and including) the relevant Early Termination Date to (but excluding) the date such amount is paid, at the Applicable Rate. Such interest will be calculated on the basis of daily compounding and the actual number of days elapsed.
7 	   	 ISDA ® 1992 Second Printing
(e) 	 Payments on Early Termination.If an Early Termination Date occurs, the following provisions shall apply based on the parties ' election in the Schedule of a payment measure, either "Market Quotation" or "Loss," and a payment method, either the "First Method" or the "Second Method." If the parties fail to designate a payment measure or payment method in the Schedule, it will be deemed that "Market Quotation" or the "Second Method," as the case may be, shall apply. The amount, if any, payable in respect of an Early Termination Date and determined pursuant to this Section will be subject to any Set-off.
(i) 	 Events of Default.If the Early Termination Date results from an Event of Default: --
(1) 	 First Method and Market Quotation. If the First Method and Market Quotation apply, the Defaulting Party will pay to the Non-defaulting Party the excess, if a positive number, of (A) the sum of the Settlement Amount (determined by the Non-defaulting Party) in respect of the Terminated Transactions and the Unpaid Amounts owing to the Non-defaulting Party over (B) the Unpaid Amounts owing to the Defaulting Party.
(2) 	 First Method and Loss. If the First Method and Loss apply, the Defaulting Party will pay to the Non-defaulting Party, if a positive number, the Non-defaulting Party's Loss in respect of this Agreement.
(3) 	 Second Method and Market Quotations. If the Second Method and Market Quotation apply, an amount will be payable equal to (A) the sum of the Settlement Amount (determined by the Non-defaulting Party) in respect of the Terminated Transactions and Unpaid Amounts owing to the Non-defaulting Party less (B) the Unpaid Amounts owing to the Defaulting Party. If that amount is a positive number, the Defaulting Party will pay it to the Non-defaulting Party; if it is a negative number, the Non-defaulting Party will pay the absolute value of that amount to the Defaulting Party.
(4) 	 Second Method and Loss. If the Second Method and Loss apply, an amount will be payable equal to the Non-defaulting Party's Loss in respect of this Agreement. If that amount is a positive number, the Defaulting Party will pay it to the Non-defaulting Party; if it is a negative number, the Non-defaulting Party will pay the absolute value of that amount to the Defaulting Party.
(ii) 	 Termination Events.If the Early Termination Date results from a Termination Event: --
(1) 	 One Affected Party. If there is one Affected Party, the amount payable will be determined in accordance with Section 6(e)(i)(3), if Market Quotation applies, or Section 6(e)(i)(4), if Loss applies, except that, in either case, references to the Defaulting Party and to the Non-defaulting Party will be deemed to be references to the Affected Party and the party which is not the Affected Party, respectively, and, if Loss applies and fewer than all the Transactions are being terminated, Loss shall be calculated in respect of all Terminated Transactions.
(2) 	 Two Affected Parties. If there are two Affected Parties:--
(A) 	 if Market Quotation applies, each party will determine a Settlement Amount in respect of the Terminated Transactions, and an amount will be payable equal to (I) the sum of (a) one-half of the difference between the Settlement Amount of the party with the higher Settlement Amount ("X") and the Settlement Amount of the party with the lower Settlement Amount ("Y") and (b) the Unpaid Amounts owing to X less (II) the Unpaid Amounts owing to Y; and
8 	   	 ISDA ® 1992 Second Printing
(B) 	 If Loss applies, each party will determine its Loss in respect of this Agreement (or, if fewer than all the Transactions are being terminated, in respect of all Terminated Transactions) and an amount will be payable equal to one-half of the difference between the Loss of the party with the higher Loss ("X") and the Loss of the party with the lower Loss ("Y").
If the amount payable is a positive number, Y will pay it to X; if it is a negative number, X will pay the absolute value of that amount to Y.
(iii) 	 Adjustment for Bankruptcy.In circumstances where an Early Termination Date occurs because "Automatic Early Termination" applies in respect of a party, the amount determined under this Section 6(e) will be subject to such adjustments as are appropriate and permitted by law to reflect any payments or deliveries made by one party to the other under this Agreement (and retained by such other party) during the period from the relevant Early Termination Date to the date for payment determined under Section 6(d)(ii).
(iv) 	 Pre-Estimate.The parties agree that if Market Quotation applies an amount recoverable under this Section  6(e) is a reasonable pre-estimate of loss and not a penalty. Such amount is payable for the loss of bargain and the loss of protection against future risks and except as otherwise provided in this Agreement neither party will be entitled to recover any additional damages as a consequence of such losses.
7. 	 Transfer
Neither this Agreement nor any interest or obligation in or under this Agreement may be transferred (whether by way of security or otherwise) by either party without the prior written consent of the other party, except that:--
(a) 	 a party may make such a transfer of this Agreement pursuant to a consolidation amalgamation with, or merger with or into, or transfer of all or substantially all its assets to, another entity (but without prejudice to any other right or remedy under this Agreement); and
(b) 	 a party may make such a transfer of all or any part of its interest in any amount payable to it from a Defaulting Party under Section 6(e).
Any purported transfer that is not in compliance with this Section will be void.
8. 	 Miscellaneous
(a) 	 Entire Agreement.This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding of the parties with respect to its subject matter and supercedes all oral communication and prior writings with respect thereto.
(b) 	 Amendments.No amendment, modification or waiver in respect of this Agreement will be effective unless in writing (including a writing evidence by a facsimile transmission) and executed by each of the parties or confirmed by an exchange of telexes or electronic messages on an electronic messaging system.
(c) 	 Survival of Obligations.Without Prejudice to Sections 2(a)(iii) and 6(c)(ii), the obligations of the parties under this Agreement will survive the termination of any Transaction.
(d) 	 Remedies Cumulative.Except as provided in this Agreement, the rights, powers, remedies, and privileges provided in this Agreement are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, powers, remedies, and privileges provided by law.
9 	   	 ISDA ® 1992 Second Printing
(e) 	 Counterparts and Confirmations.
(i) 	 This Agreement (and each amendment, modification, and waiver in respect of it) may be executed and delivered in counterparts (including by facsimile transmission), each of which will be deemed an original.
(ii) 	 The parties intend that they are legally bound by the terms of each Transaction from the moment they agree to those terms (whether orally or otherwise). A Confirmation shall be entered into as soon as practicable and may be executed and delivered in counterparts (including by facsimile transmission) or be created by an exchange of telexes or by an exchange of electronic messages on an electronic messaging system, which in each case will be sufficient for all purposes to evidence a binding supplement to this Agreement. The parties will specify therein or through another effective means that any such counterpart, telex or electronic message constitutes a Confirmation.
(f) 	 No Waiver of Rights.A failure or delay in exercising any right, power or privilege in respect of this Agreement will not be presumed to operate as a waiver, and a single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege will not be presumed to preclude any subsequent or further exercise, of that right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.
(g) 	 Headings.The headings used in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and are not to affect the construction of or to be taken into consideration in interpreting this Agreement.
9. 	 Expenses
A Defaulting Party will, on demand, indemnify and hold harmless the other party for and against all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including legal fees, incurred by such other party by reason of the enforcement and protection of its rights under this Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which the Defaulting Party is a party or by reason of the early termination of any Transaction, including, but not limited to, costs of collection.
10. 	 Notices

(b) 	 Change of Addresses. Either party may by notice to the other change the address, telex, or facsimile number or electronic messaging system details at which notices or other communications are to be given to it.
11. 	 Governing Law and Jurisdiction
(a) 	 Governing Law.This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the law specified in the Schedule.
(b) 	 Jurisdiction.With respect to any suit, action, or proceedings relating to this Agreement ( "Proceedings"), each party irrevocably:--
(i) 	 submits to the jurisdiction of the English courts, if this Agreement is expressed to be governed by English law, or to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York and the United States District Court located in the Borough of Manhattan in New York City, if this Agreement is expressed to be governed by the laws of the State of New York; and

(a) 	 the Market Quotations (whether positive or negative) for each Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions for which a Market Quotation is determined; and

14 	   	 ISDA ® 1992 Second Printing
of such amounts, from (and including) the date such amounts or obligations were or would have been required to have been paid or performed to (but excluding) such Early Termination Date, at the Applicable Rate. Such amounts of interest will be calculated on the basis of daily compounding and the actual number of days elapsed. The fair market value of any obligation referred to in clause (b) above shall be reasonably determined by the party obliged to make the determination under Section 6(e) or, if each party is so obliged, it shall be the average of the fair market values reasonably determined by both parties.

For any such Specified Transaction not evidenced by a Confirmation, Section 2(a)(i) of this Agreement is amended to read as follows: "(i) Each party will make each payment or delivery to be made by it under each Transaction, as specified in each Confirmation (or otherwise in accordance with the terms of that Transaction if not evidenced by a Confirmation), subject to the other provisions of this Agreement." In addition, any Specified Transaction between the parties evidenced by a Confirmation that by its terms specifies that it is subject to or governed by this Agreement (or an ISDA Master Agreement between the parties), whether entered into before, on or after the date of this Agreement, shall constitute a Transaction under this Agreement and shall be subject to, governed by, and construed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
(k) 	 Transfer. Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 7 of this Agreement, if Party A's rights in any loan or extension of credit under any Financial Agreement are sold, assigned or otherwise transferred to any purchaser, assignee or transferee to which Party A may lawfully make such sale, assignment or transfer, then Party A may transfer without recourse its rights and obligations in or under this Agreement (and any Credit Support Document) to any such purchaser, assignee or transferee, provided that Party B is provided with written notice of such transfer and a written acknowledgement of the purchaser, assignee or transferee stating that it has acquired such rights and obligations of Party A and is bound by the terms of this Agreement (and any Credit Support Document) as Party A's successor hereunder (and thereunder).

(l) 	 Independent Obligations. (i) Although Party B may be entering into one or more Transactions under this Agreement to hedge against the interest expense of, or other risk associated with, an existing or future loan or other financing, this Agreement and each Transaction shall be an independent obligation of Party B separate and apart from any such loan or other financing, and therefore: (A) each party's obligations under this Agreement or any Transaction shall not be contingent on whether any loan or other financing closes, is outstanding or is repaid, in whole or in part, at any time; (B) subject to paragraph (ii) below, any repayment, acceleration, satisfaction, discharge or release of, and any amendment, modification or waiver with respect to, any loan or other financing, whether in whole or in part, at any time, shall not in any way affect this Agreement, any Transaction or either party's obligations under this Agreement or any Transaction; (C) payments that become due under this Agreement or any Transaction shall be due whether or not (1) the Notional Amount of any Transaction at any time is different from the principal amount of any loan or other financing, (2) the Termination Date of any Transaction occurs before or after the maturity date of any loan or other financing, or (3) any other terms of any loan or other financing are different from the terms of this Agreement or any Transaction; (D) nothing in this Agreement or in any Confirmation is intended to be, nor shall anything herein or therein be construed as, a prepayment penalty, charge or premium for purposes of any loan or other financing, nor shall any terms of any loan or other financing be deemed a waiver of or otherwise impair any amount due or that may become due under this Agreement or under any Transaction; (E) if Party B at any time receives from Party A (or any of its affiliates) any payoff statement or other written statement regarding any loan or other financing, nothing in such statement shall be deemed to apply to this Agreement or any Transaction except as otherwise expressly provided in that statement and then only to the extent so provided; and (F) if at any time any existing or future collateral or other credit support secures or otherwise supports both this Agreement (or any Transaction hereunder) and any loan or other financing (whether this Agreement or any Transaction hereunder is specifically identified in the collateral or credit support documents, or instead is referred to therein generically), then such collateral or other credit support shall continue to secure or otherwise support Party B's obligations under this Agreement (or any Transaction hereunder) until such time as all such obligations of Party B are completely satisfied notwithstanding any repayment, acceleration, satisfaction, discharge or release of any such loan or other financing.
(ii) Nothing in paragraph (i) above shall be construed as impairing or limiting: any set-off rights; any cross default, credit support default or other provisions contained in this Agreement or any Confirmation to the extent such provisions refer to any repayment or acceleration of any loan or other financing; any rights or obligations under any Credit Support Documents; or any obligations of Party B under any covenant incorporated in this Schedule by reference from any loan or other financing (provided that any amendment, modification or waiver executed and delivered by Party A in writing with respect to any such covenant shall be deemed to apply hereunder to that covenant as so incorporated unless otherwise expressly provided in such writing).
(m) 	 Notice by Facsimile Transmission. Section 10(a) is hereby amended by deleting the parenthetical "(except that a notice or other communication under Section 5 or 6 may not be given by facsimile transmission or electronic messaging system)".
