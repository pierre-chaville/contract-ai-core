("ISDA") and will be governed in all respects by the Definitions (except that references to "Swap Transactions" shall be deemed to be references to "Transactions"). The Definitions are incorporated by reference in, and made part of, this Agreement and each Confirmation as if set forth in full in this Agreement and such Confirmations. In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of this Agreement and the Definitions, this Agreement will prevail (and, in the event of any inconsistency between any Confirmation and the Definitions, the Confirmation will control). Any reference in a Confirmation to any Definitions which are amended or supplemented in this Schedule shall be deemed to be a reference to such Definitions as so amended or supplemented, unless the Confirmation states, by specific reference to any such amendment or supplement, that such amendment or supplement will not apply in respect of the Transaction to which such Confirmation relates.

To the extent that Party A elects or is required to post collateral pursuant to this Part 5(b)(1), Party A shall request its legal counsel to deliver to each applicable Rating Agency within thirty (30) calendar days of the occurrence of such Collateralization Event an opinion as to the enforceability of the ISDA Credit Support Annex.

(b)
If Party A has not obtained a substitute counterparty as set forth in (3)(a) above within 30 days (or, in the case of a failure to meet the requirements of subparagraph (A) of the definition of "Hedge Counterparty Ratings Threshold", within 15 Business Days) of the Ratings Event, then Party A shall continue to seek a substitute counterparty and, on or prior to the expiration of such period, post collateral according to the terms of an ISDA 1994 New York Law Credit Support Annex.
