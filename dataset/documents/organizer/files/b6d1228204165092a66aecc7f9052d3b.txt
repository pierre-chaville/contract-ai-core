(i) Relationship Between Parties. Each party will be deemed to represent to the other party on the date on which it enters into a Relevant Agreement that:
(1)	 Non-Reliance. It is acting for its own account, and it has made its own independent decisions to enter into the Relevant Agreement and as to whether the Relevant Agreement is appropriate or proper for it based solely upon its own judgment and upon advice from such advisers as it has deemed necessary. It is not relying on any communication (written or oral) of the other party or any of its affiliates (or its respective representatives) as investment advice or as a recommendation to enter into the Relevant Agreement, it being understood that information and explanations related to the terms and conditions of any Relevant Agreement will not be considered investment advice or a recommendation to enter into the Relevant Agreement. No communication (written or oral) received from the other party or any of its affiliates (or its respective representatives) will be deemed to be an assurance or guarantee as to the expected results of the Relevant Agreement.
(2)	 Assessment and Understanding. It is capable of assessing the merits of and understanding (on its own behalf or through independent professional advice), and understands and accepts, the terms, conditions and risks of the Relevant Agreement based solely upon its own evaluation of the Relevant Agreement (including the present and future results, consequences, risks, and benefits thereof, whether financial, accounting, tax, legal, or otherwise) or that of its own advisers. It is also capable of assuming, and assumes, the risks of the Relevant Agreement. It also understands that the terms under which any Transaction may be terminated early are set forth in this Agreement (or in the relevant Confirmation), and any early termination of a Transaction other than pursuant to such terms is subject to mutual agreement of the parties confirmed in writing, the terms of which may require one party to pay an early termination fee to the other party based upon market conditions prevailing at the time of early termination.
(3)	 Status of Parties. The other party is not acting as a fiduciary for or an adviser to it in respect of the Relevant Agreement, and any agency, brokerage, advisory or fiduciary services that the other party (or any of its affiliates) may otherwise provide to the party (or to any of its affiliates) excludes the Relevant Agreement.
"Relevant Agreement" means this Agreement, each Transaction, each Confirmation, any Credit Support Document, or any agreement (including any amendment, modification, transfer or early termination) between the parties relating to this Agreement or to any Transaction, Confirmation or Credit Support Document.
(ii) Eligibility. Each party will be deemed to represent to the other party on the date on which it enters into a Transaction that it is an "eligible contract participant" within the meaning of the Commodity Exchange Act.
(iii) ERISA. Each party represents to the other party at all times hereunder that it is not (i) an employee benefit plan as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), or a plan as defined in Section 4975(e)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code"), subject to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, or a plan as so defined but which is not subject to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code but is subject to another law materially similar to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (each of which, an "ERISA Plan"), (ii) a person or entity acting on behalf of an ERISA Plan, or (iii) a person or entity the assets of which constitute assets of an ERISA Plan.
(d)	 Set-off. Any amount ("Early Termination Amount") payable to one party ("Payee") by the other party ("Payer") under Section 6(e), in circumstances where there is a Defaulting Party or one Affected Party in the case where either a Termination Event under Section 5(b)(iv) or any other Termination Event in which all outstanding Transactions are Affected Transactions has occurred, will, at the option of the party ("X") other than the Defaulting Party or the Affected Party (and without prior notice to the Defaulting Party or the Affected Party), be reduced by means of set off against any amount(s) ("Other Agreement Amount") payable (whether at such time or in the future or upon the occurrence of a contingency) by the Payee to the Payer or to any Affiliate of the Payer (irrespective of the currency, place of payment or booking office of the obligation) under any other agreement(s) between the Payee and the Payer (or between the Payee and any Affiliate of the Payer) or instrument(s) or undertaking(s) issued or executed by the Payee to, or in the favor of, the Payer or any Affiliate of the Payer (and the Other Agreement Amount will be discharged promptly and in all respects to the extent it is so set-off). X will give notice to the other party of any set-off effected under this paragraph.
For this purpose, either the Early Termination Amount or the Other Agreement Amount (or the relevant portion of such amounts) may be converted by X into the currency in which the other is denominated at the rate of exchange at which such party would be able, acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith, to purchase the relevant amount of such currency. The term "rate of exchange" includes, without limitation, any premiums and costs of exchange payable in connection with the purchase of or conversion into the relevant currency.
Nothing in this paragraph shall be effective to create a charge or other security interest. This paragraph shall be without prejudice and in addition to any right of set-off, combination of accounts, lien or other right to which any party is at any time otherwise entitled (whether by operation of law, contract or otherwise).
(e)	 Escrow. If payments denominated in different currencies are due hereunder by both parties on the same day and a party has reasonable cause to believe that the other party will not meet its payment obligation, then as reasonable assurance of performance the party may notify the other party that payments on that date are to be made in escrow. In this case, deposit of the payment due earlier on that date shall be made by 2.00 p.m. (local time at the place for the earlier payment) on that date with any escrow agent selected by the party giving the notice from among major commercial banks independent of either party (and its affiliates), accompanied by irrevocable payment instructions
(i) to release the deposited payment to the intended recipient upon receipt by the escrow agent of the required deposit of the corresponding payment from the other party on the same date accompanied by irrevocable payment instructions to the same effect or (ii) if the required deposit of the corresponding payment is not made on the same date, to return the payment deposited to the party that paid in escrow. The party that elects to have payments made in escrow shall pay the costs of the escrow arrangements and shall make arrangements to provide that the intended recipient of the amount due to be deposited first shall be entitled to interest on the deposited payment for each day in the period of its deposit at the rate offered by the escrow agent for that day for overnight deposits in the relevant currency in the office where it holds that deposited payment (at 11.00 a.m. local time on that day) if that payment is not released by 5.00 p.m. local time on the date it is deposited for any reason other than the intended recipient's failure to make the escrow deposit it is required to make hereunder in a timely fashion.
(f)	 Recording of Conversations. Each party (i) consents to the recording of telephone conversations between the trading, marketing and other relevant personnel of the parties or any of their Affiliates in connection with this Agreement or any Transaction or potential Transaction, (ii) agrees to obtain any necessary consent of, and give any necessary notice of such recording to, its relevant personnel and those of its Affiliates and (iii) agrees, to the extent permitted by applicable law, that such recordings may be submitted in evidence in any Proceedings.
(g)	 Confirmation Procedures. Upon receipt thereof, Party B shall examine the terms of each Confirmation sent by Party A, and unless Party B objects to the terms within three New York business days after receipt of that Confirmation, those terms shall be deemed accepted and correct absent manifest error, in which case that Confirmation will be sufficient to form a binding supplement to this Agreement notwithstanding Section 9(e)(ii) of this Agreement.
(h)	 Covenants of Credit Agreement.
(i) Party B shall provide Party A at all times hereunder with the same covenant protection as Party B provides Party A (or any of its Affiliates) under the Credit Agreement. Therefore, in addition to the Cross Default provisions of this Agreement, and notwithstanding the satisfaction of any obligation or promise to pay money to Party A (or any of its Affiliates) under the Credit Agreement, or the termination or cancellation of the Credit Agreement, Party B hereby agrees to perform, comply with and observe for the benefit of Party A hereunder all affirmative and negative covenants contained in the Credit Agreement applicable to Party B (excluding any obligation or promise to pay money under the Credit Agreement) at any time Party B has any obligation (whether absolute or contingent) under this Agreement.
(ii) For purposes hereof: (A) the affirmative and negative covenants of the Credit Agreement applicable to Party B (together with related definitions and ancillary provisions, but in any event excluding any obligation or promise to pay money under the Credit Agreement) are incorporated by reference herein (mutatis mutandis); (B) if lenders or creditors other than Party A are parties to the Credit Agreement, then references therein to the lenders or creditors shall be deemed references to Party A; and (C) for any such covenant applying only when any loan, other extension of credit, obligation or commitment under the Credit Agreement is outstanding, that covenant shall be deemed to apply hereunder at any time Party B has any obligation (whether absolute or contingent) under this Agreement.
(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the incorporation of any provision by reference from the Credit Agreement would result in the violation by Party B of the terms of the Credit Agreement, or be in violation of any law, rule or regulation (as interpreted by any court of competent jurisdiction), then this Agreement shall not incorporate that provision.

(c)	 Currency Option Transactions.
(i) Currency Option Transaction Premiums. If any Premium of a Currency Option Transaction is not received on the Premium Payment Date, then the Seller may elect to either (A) accept late payment of that Premium, or (B) give written notice of that nonpayment and, if that payment is not received within one Local Business Day of that notice, either (1) treat the related Currency Option Transaction as void, or (2) treat that non‑payment as an Event of Default under Section 5(a)(i) of this Agreement. If the Seller elects to act under clause (A) or (B)(1) of the preceding sentence, then the Buyer shall pay on demand all out‑of‑pocket costs and actual damages incurred by the Seller in connection with that unpaid or late Premium or void Currency Option Transaction, including, without limitation, interest on that Premium in the same currency as that Premium at the Default Rate and any other costs or expenses incurred by the Seller to compensate it for its loss of bargain, cost of funding or loss incurred as a result of terminating, liquidating, obtaining or re‑establishing a delta hedge or other related trading position with respect to that Currency Option Transaction.
(ii) Netting of Currency Option Transactions. Section 2(c) of this Agreement shall not apply to Currency Option Transactions. Instead, the following provisions will apply to Currency Option Transactions:
(A) If Premiums in the same currency would be due by both parties in respect of the same Premium Payment Date under two or more Currency Option Transactions between the same pair of Offices of the parties (assuming satisfaction of each condition precedent), then the obligations of the parties for those Premiums will be discharged automatically, and if one party's obligation in that currency would have been greater, replaced by an obligation of that party to pay or deliver the amount of that difference to the other party.
(B) If amounts in the same currency (other than Premiums) would be due by both parties in respect of the same Settlement Date (or other payment or delivery date) under two or more Currency Option Transactions between the same pair of Offices of the parties (assuming satisfaction of each condition precedent), then the obligations of the parties for those amounts will be discharged automatically, and if one party's obligation in that currency would have been greater, replaced by an obligation of that party to pay or deliver the amount of that difference to the other party on that Settlement Date or date.
(C) For matching Currency Option Transactions, any unexercised Call or Put written by a party will automatically be terminated and discharged, in whole or in part, as applicable, against any unexercised Call or Put, respectively, written by the other party upon the payment in full of both Currency Option Transaction Premiums. Currency Option Transactions are "matching" only if both
(i) are granted for the same Put Currency, Call Currency, Expiration Date, Expiration Time, and Strike Price, (ii) have the same exercise style (e.g., American, European or Asian) including the same exercise terms, and (iii) are entered into by the same pair of Offices of the parties. For any partial termination and discharge (where the Currency Option Transactions are for different amounts of the Currency Pair), the remaining portion of the Currency Option Transaction shall continue to be a Currency Option Transaction under this Agreement.
(d)	 Notice of Exercise. Notwithstanding Section 3.5 (g) of the 1998 FX and Currency Option Definitions, a Notice of Exercise may be delivered by facsimile for purposes of exercising a Currency Option only if, after reasonable efforts have been made by the Buyer to deliver such Notice of Exercise orally by telephone, Buyer is unable to reach an appropriate person at the Seller by telephone on the relevant day for purposes of exercising such Currency Option on that day. Whenever a Notice of Exercise has been given orally by telephone, a confirmation of such Notice of Exercise may be delivered in writing by facsimile or by any other means specified therefore in the relevant Confirmation.
(e)	 Payment versus Delivery. Absent the existence of an Event of Default or Potential Event of Default with respect to either party, Party A may, in its sole determination with respect to a Settlement Date (or other date upon which a payment or delivery is due) in respect of FX Transactions, Currency Option Transactions, or Currency Obligations, as the case may be, require Party B to pay or deliver in advance of Party A remitting funds to Party B (i.e., on a "payment versus delivery" basis)(each a "PVD Transaction"). Upon such determination, Party A will provide notice and instructions to Party B and thereafter, receipt of payment or delivery by Party B shall be a condition precedent to Party A's obligation to perform its side of the PVD Transaction.
If Party B does not subsequently make timely payment or delivery with respect to a PVD Transaction as specified by Party A, such failure shall be deemed an Additional Termination Event and Party B shall be the Affected Party.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Schedule by their duly authorized signatories as of the date hereof.
