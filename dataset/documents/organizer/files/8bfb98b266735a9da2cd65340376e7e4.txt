Based upon the foregoing, we are of the following opinion:

6.     To the best of our knowledge, after due inquiry, there is not pending or threatened against the Counterparty or any of its Affiliates any action, suit or proceeding at law or in equity or before any court, tribunal, government body, agency or official or any arbitrator that is likely to affect the legality, validity or enforceability against the Counterparty of the Agreement or its ability to perform its obligations thereunder.
We are qualified to practice law in                        and do not purport to be expert on, or to express any opinion herein concerning, any law other than the laws of                         [, the Delaware General Corporation Law] [and the federal laws of the United States of America].

Exhibit  III
GUARANTY
GUARANTY, dated as of                        , 2003, between Harrah's Entertainment, Inc. (the "Guarantor") and [Name] (the "Bank").
RECITALS
Harrah's Operating Company, Inc. (the "Counterparty") and the Bank are parties to a 2002 Master Agreement, dated as of                        , 2003 (the "Agreement"). The Agreement provides that the Counterparty is required to provide the Bank with a Guaranty duly executed by the Guarantor containing the terms and conditions set forth herein. Capitalized terms used herein not otherwise defined have the meanings assigned to them in the Agreement. Pursuant to the Agreement and as an inducement to the Bank to enter into the Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Bank and the Guarantor agree as follows:
1.     Guaranty of Payment.    The Guarantor, as primary obligor and not as surety only, hereby unconditionally guarantees the due and punctual payment (whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration, early termination or otherwise) of any amounts arising out of or in connection with the Agreement, including without limitation the obligation of the Counterparty to pay any Fixed Amounts or Floating Amounts, any settlement amounts due and owing pursuant to Section 6 of the Agreement and all expenses of collection, counsel fees and other expenses incurred by the Bank in connection with the enforcement of its rights under the Agreement (collectively, the "Guaranteed Obligations"). Upon any failure by the Counterparty to pay any of the Guaranteed Obligations, the Guarantor agrees that it will forthwith on demand pay, at the place and in the manner specified in the Agreement, such amounts which the Counterparty has failed to pay. This Guaranty is a guaranty of payment and not merely a guaranty of collection.
2.     Guaranty Unconditional and Absolute.    The obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall be unconditional and absolute and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, shall not be released, discharged or otherwise affected by:
(i)  any extension, renewal, settlement, compromise, waiver or release in respect of any obligation of the Counterparty or any other guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations;
(ii)  any release, exchange, non-perfection or invalidity of any direct or indirect security for any of the Guaranteed Obligations;
(iii)  any modification or amendment of or supplement to the Agreement;
(iv)  any change in the corporate existence (including its constitution, laws, rules, regulations or powers), structure or ownership of the Counterparty or the Guarantor, or any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting the Counterparty or its assets, the Guarantor or any other guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations;
(v)  the existence of any claim, set-off or other rights which the Guarantor may have at any time against the Counterparty, the Bank or any other corporation or person, whether in connection herewith or in connection with any unrelated transaction; provided that nothing herein shall prevent the assertion of any such claim by separate suit or compulsory counterclaim;
(vi)  any invalidity or unenforceability relating to or against the Counterparty or any other guarantor for any reason of the Agreement or any other guaranty agreement, or any provision of applicable law or regulation purporting to prohibit payment by the Counterparty of amounts to be paid by it under the Agreement or any of the Guaranteed Obligations or under any such guaranty agreement; or
(vii)  any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind by the Counterparty, any other guarantor, the Bank or any other corporation or person or any other circumstance whatsoever which might, but for the provisions of this paragraph, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of the Guarantor's obligations hereunder.
3.     Discharge Only Upon Payment In Full; Reinstatement in Certain Circumstances.    The Guarantor's obligations hereunder constitute a guarantee of payment and not of collection merely and shall remain in full force and effect until the Guaranteed Obligations shall have been paid in full in accordance with the terms hereof and of the Agreement. If at any time any payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must be otherwise restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Counterparty or otherwise, the Guarantor's obligations hereunder with respect to such payment shall be reinstated at such time as though such payment had not been made.
4.     Waiver by the Guarantor.    The Guarantor irrevocably waives acceptance hereof, diligence, presentment, demand, protest, notice of dishonor and any notice not provided for herein, as well as any requirement that at any time any person exhaust any right or take any action against the Counterparty or its assets or any other guarantor or person.
5.     Subrogation.    Upon making any payment hereunder, the Guarantor shall be subrogated to the rights of the Bank against the Counterparty with respect to such payment; provided that the Guarantor shall not enforce any right or receive any payment by way of subrogation until all of the Guaranteed Obligations shall have been paid in full.
6.     Stay of Acceleration Ineffective with respect to Guarantor.    In the event that acceleration of the time for payment of any amount payable by the Counterparty under the Agreement is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Counterparty, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration or required to be paid upon an early termination pursuant to the terms of the Agreement shall nonetheless be payable by the Guarantor hereunder forthwith on demand by the Bank.
7.     Assignment; Successors and Assigns.    The Guaranty shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Guarantor and its successors and assigns and the Bank and its successors and assigns. The Guarantor may not transfer or assign its rights and obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Bank, and any such purported assignment without the written consent of the Bank will be void.
8.     Amendments and Waivers.    No provision of this Guaranty may be amended, supplemented or modified, nor any of the terms and conditions hereof or thereof waived, except by a written instrument executed by the Guarantor and the Bank.
9.     Expenses and Taxes.    Without limiting the generality of the Guarantor's obligations hereunder, the Guarantor agrees to pay to the Bank upon its request all reasonable costs and expenses, including fees and disbursements of counsel and taxes, incurred by the Bank in connection with the occurrence of any Event of Default under the Agreement and collection or other enforcement proceedings against any person or assets resulting therefrom, all of which shall be "Guaranteed Obligations" the payment of which is guaranteed hereunder. The Guarantor agrees that all amounts payable under this Guaranty shall be paid without set-off or counterclaim and free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of any present or future taxes, levies, imposts, duties, fees, assessments or other charges of whatever nature, now or hereafter imposed by any governmental or taxing authority to which the Guarantor is subject.
10.     Waiver of Jury Trial.    Each party waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Guaranty.
11.     Governing Law.    This Guaranty shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the State of New York.
12.     Jurisdiction.    With respect to any suit, action or proceedings relating to this Guaranty, the Guarantor irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York and the United States District Court located in the Borough of Manhattan in New York City and hereby waives any objection which it may have at any time to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceedings brought in any such court, waives any claim that such suit, action or proceedings have been brought in an inconvenient forum and further waives the right to object, with respect to such suit, action or proceedings, that such court does not have any jurisdiction over such party.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Guaranty to be duly executed as of the date first above written.
