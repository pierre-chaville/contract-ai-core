(i) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining LIBOR (or any other U.S. dollar LIBOR rate utilized in any of the Transaction Documents (LIBOR and any such other U.S. dollar LIBOR rate, an "Affected LIBOR Rate") for any period during the term of the Agreement, including, without limitation, because the Affected LIBOR Rate is not available or published on a current basis and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary; or
(ii) the administrator of any Affected LIBOR Rate or a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over Party A has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which such Affected LIBOR Rate shall no longer be made available, or used for determining the interest rate of loans, provided that, at the time of such statement, there is no successor administrator that is satisfactory to Party A, that will continue to provide such Affected LIBOR Rate after such specific date (such specific date, the "Scheduled Unavailability Date"); or
(iii) working capital facilities, other loan facilities or trading facilities currently being executed, or that include language similar to that contained in this Part 20(d), are being executed or amended (as applicable) to incorporate or adopt a new benchmark interest rate to replace the Affected LIBOR Rate,

dollar denominated credit or trading facilities for such alternative benchmarks and, in each case, including any mathematical or other adjustments to such benchmark giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar U.S. dollar denominated credit or trading facilities for such benchmarks, which adjustment or method for calculating such adjustment shall be published on an information service as selected by Party A from time to time in its reasonable discretion and may be periodically updated (the "Adjustment;" and any such proposed rate, a "LIBOR Successor Rate"). Such LIBOR Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner consistent with market practice; provided that to the extent such market practice is not administratively feasible for Party A, such LIBOR Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner as otherwise reasonably determined by Party A.
If no LIBOR Successor Rate has been determined and the circumstances under clause (i) above exist or the Scheduled Unavailability Date has occurred (as applicable), Party A will promptly so notify Party B, and, thereafter, any reference or usage of the Affected LIBOR Rate herein or in any other Transaction Document shall instead refer or use the LIBOR Successor Rate as defined herein. Notwithstanding anything else herein, any definition of LIBOR Successor Rate shall provide that in no event shall such LIBOR Successor Rate be less than zero for purposes of this Agreement or any other Transaction Document. For the avoidance of doubt, this Part 20(d) shall apply to each Transaction Document and apply to any reference or usage of any Affected LIBOR Rate therein or in any trade documentation entered into in connection with this Agreement.
In connection with the implementation of a LIBOR Successor Rate, Party A will have the right to make LIBOR Successor Rate Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Transaction Document, any amendments implementing such LIBOR Successor Rate Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement.

"Relevant Governmental Body" means the Federal Reserve Board and/or the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or a committee officially endorsed or convened by
