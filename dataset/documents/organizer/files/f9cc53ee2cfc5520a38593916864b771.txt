2002 MASTER AGREEMENT
dated as of July 12, 2017
JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., a national banking association organized under the laws of the United States of America ("Party A") 	   	 and 	   	  CMF TT II, LLC, a limited liability corporation organized under Delaware law ("Party B")
have entered and/or anticipate entering into one or more transactions (each a "Transaction") that are or will be governed by this 2002 Master Agreement, which includes the schedule (the "Schedule"), and the documents and other confirming evidence (each a "Confirmation") exchanged between the parties or otherwise effective for the purpose of confirming or evidencing those Transactions. This 2002 Master Agreement and the Schedule are together referred to as this "Master Agreement".
Accordingly, the parties agree as follows:--
1. 	  Interpretation
(a) Definitions. The terms defined in Section 14 and elsewhere in this Master Agreement will have the meanings therein specified for the purpose of this Master Agreement.
(b) Inconsistency. In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of the Schedule and the other provisions of this Master Agreement, the Schedule will prevail. In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of any Confirmation and this Master Agreement, such Confirmation will prevail for the purpose of the relevant Transaction.
(c) Single Agreement. All Transactions are entered into in reliance on the fact that this Master Agreement and all Confirmations form a single agreement between the parties (collectively referred to as this "Agreement"), and the parties would not otherwise enter into any Transactions.
2. 	  Obligations
(a) General Conditions.
(i) Each party will make each payment or delivery specified in each Confirmation to be made by it, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement.
(ii) Payments under this Agreement will be made on the due date for value on that date in the place of the account specified in the relevant Confirmation or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement, in freely transferable funds and in the manner customary for payments in the required currency. Where settlement is by delivery (that is, other than by payment), such delivery will be made for receipt on the due date in the manner customary for the relevant obligation unless otherwise specified in the relevant Confirmation or elsewhere in this Agreement.

(iii) Each obligation of each party under Section 2(a)(i) is subject to (1) the condition precedent that no Event of Default or Potential Event of Default with respect to the other party has occurred and is continuing, (2) the condition precedent that no Early Termination Date in respect of the relevant Transaction has occurred or been effectively designated and (3) each other condition specified in this Agreement to be a condition precedent for the purpose of this Section 2(a)(iii).
(b) Change of Account. Either party may change its account for receiving a payment or delivery by giving notice to the other party at least five Local Business Days prior to the Scheduled Settlement Date for the payment or delivery to which such change applies unless such other party gives timely notice of a reasonable objection to such change.
(c) Netting of Payments. If on any date amounts would otherwise be payable:--
(i) in the same currency; and
(ii) in respect of the same Transaction,
by each party to the other, then, on such date, each party's obligation to make payment of any such amount will be automatically satisfied and discharged and, if the aggregate amount that would otherwise have been payable by one party exceeds the aggregate amount that would otherwise have been payable by the other party, replaced by an obligation upon the party by which the larger aggregate amount would have been payable to pay to the other party the excess of the larger aggregate amount over the smaller aggregate amount.
The parties may elect in respect of two or more Transactions that a net amount and payment obligation will be determined in respect of all amounts payable on the same date in the same currency in respect of those Transactions, regardless of whether such amounts are payable in respect of the same Transaction. The election may be made in the Schedule or any Confirmation by specifying that "Multiple Transaction Payment Netting" applies to the Transactions identified as being subject to the election (in which case clause (ii) above will not apply to such Transactions). If Multiple Transaction Payment Netting is applicable to Transactions, it will apply to those Transactions with effect from the starting date specified in the Schedule or such Confirmation, or, if a starting date is not specified in the Schedule or such Confirmation, the starting date otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. This election may be made separately for different groups of Transactions and will apply separately to each pairing of Offices through which the parties make and receive payments or deliveries.
(d) Deduction or Withholding for Tax.
(i) Gross-Up. All payments under this Agreement will be made without any deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax unless such deduction or withholding is required by any applicable law, as modified by the practice of any relevant governmental revenue authority, then in effect. If a party is so required to deduct or withhold, then that party ("X") will:--
(1) promptly notify the other party ("Y") of such requirement;
(2) pay to the relevant authorities the full amount required to be deducted or withheld (including the full amount required to be deducted or withheld from any additional amount paid by X to Y under this Section 2(d)) promptly upon the earlier of determining that such deduction or withholding is required or receiving notice that such amount has been assessed against Y;
(3) promptly forward to Y an official receipt (or a certified copy), or other documentation reasonably acceptable to Y, evidencing such payment to such authorities; and
2 	    	 ISDA® 2002
(4) if such Tax is an Indemnifiable Tax, pay to Y, in addition to the payment to which Y is otherwise entitled under this Agreement, such additional amount as is necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by Y (free and clear of lndemnifiable Taxes, whether assessed against X or Y) will equal the full amount Y would have received had no such deduction or withholding been required. However, X will not be required to pay any additional amount to Y to the extent that it would not be required to be paid but for:--
(A) the failure by Y to comply with or perform any agreement contained in Section 4(a)(i), 4(a)(iii) or 4(d); or
(B) the failure of a representation made by Y pursuant to Section 3(f) to be accurate and true unless such failure would not have occurred but for (I) any action taken by a taxing authority, or brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, after a Transaction is entered into (regardless of whether such action is taken or brought with respect to a party to this Agreement) or (II) a Change in Tax Law.
(ii)Liability. If:--
(1) X is required by any applicable law, as modified by the practice of any relevant governmental revenue authority, to make any deduction or withholding in respect of which X would not be required to pay an additional amount to Y under Section 2(d)(i)(4);
(2) X does not so deduct or withhold; and
(3) a liability resulting from such Tax is assessed directly against X,
then, except to the extent Y has satisfied or then satisfies the liability resulting from such Tax, Y will promptly pay to X the amount of such liability (including any related liability for interest, but including any related liability for penalties only if Y has failed to comply with or perform any agreement contained in Section 4(a)(i), 4(a)(iii) or 4(d)).
3. 	  Representations
Each party makes the representations contained in Sections 3(a), 3(b), 3(c), 3(d), 3(e) and 3(f) and, if specified in the Schedule as applying, 3(g) to the other party (which representations will be deemed to be repeated by each party on each date on which a Transaction is entered into and, in the case of the representations in Section 3(f), at all times until the termination of this Agreement). If any "Additional Representation" is specified in the Schedule or any Confirmation as applying, the party or parties specified for such Additional Representation will make and, if applicable, be deemed to repeat such Additional Representation at the time or times specified for such Additional Representation.

The occurrence at any time with respect to a party or, if applicable, any Credit Support Provider of such party or any Specified Entity of such party of any of the following events constitutes (subject to Sections 5(c) and 6(e)(iv)) an event of default (an "Event of Default") with respect to such party:--

(3) the party or such Credit Support Provider disaffirms, disclaims, repudiates or rejects, in whole or in part, or challenges the validity of, such Credit Support Document (or such action is taken by any person or entity appointed or empowered to operate it or act on its behalf);
(iv) Misrepresentation. A representation (other than a representation under Section 3(e) or 3(f)) made or repeated or deemed to have been made or repeated by the party or any Credit Support Provider of such party in this Agreement or any Credit Support Document proves to have been incorrect or misleading in any material respect when made or repeated or deemed to have been made or repeated;

(2) the benefits of any Credit Support Document fail to extend (without the consent of the other party) to the performance by such resulting, surviving or transferee entity of its obligations under this Agreement.
(b) Termination Events. The occurrence at any time with respect to a party or, if applicable, any Credit Support Provider of such party or any Specified Entity of such party of any event specified below constitutes (subject to Section 5(c)) an Illegality if the event is specified in clause
(i) below, a Force Majeure Event if the event is specified in clause (ii) below, a Tax Event if the event is specified in clause (iii) below, a Tax Event Upon Merger if the event is specified in clause (iv) below, and, if specified to be applicable, a Credit Event Upon Merger if the event is specified pursuant to clause (v) below or an Additional Termination Event if the event is specified pursuant to clause (vi) below:--
(i) Illegality. After giving effect to any applicable provision, disruption fallback or remedy specified in, or pursuant to, the relevant Confirmation or elsewhere in this Agreement, due to an event or circumstance (other than any action taken by a party or, if applicable, any Credit Support Provider of such party) occurring after a Transaction is entered into, it becomes unlawful under any applicable law (including without limitation the laws of any country in which payment, delivery or compliance is required by either party or any Credit Support Provider, as the case may be), on any day, or it would be unlawful if the relevant payment, delivery or compliance were required on that day (in each case, other than as a result of a breach by the party of Section 4(b)):--
(1) for the Office through which such party (which will be the Affected Party) makes and receives payments or deliveries with respect to such Transaction to perform any absolute or contingent obligation to make a payment or delivery in respect of such Transaction, to receive a payment or delivery in respect of such Transaction or to comply with any other material provision of this Agreement relating to such Transaction; or
(2) for such party or any Credit Support Provider of such party (which will be the Affected Party) to perform any absolute or contingent obligation to make a payment or delivery which such party or Credit Support Provider has under any Credit Support Document relating to such Transaction, to receive a payment or delivery under such Credit Support Document or to comply with any other material provision of such Credit Support Document;
(ii) Force Majeure Event. After giving effect to any applicable provision, disruption fallback or remedy specified in, or pursuant to, the relevant Confirmation or elsewhere in this Agreement, by reason of force majeure or act of state occurring after a Transaction is entered into, on any day:--
(1) the Office through which such party (which will be the Affected Party) makes and receives payments or deliveries with respect to such Transaction is prevented from performing any absolute or contingent obligation to make a payment or delivery in respect of such Transaction, from receiving a payment or delivery in respect of such Transaction or from complying with any other material provision of this Agreement relating to such Transaction (or would be so prevented if such payment, delivery or compliance were required on that day), or it becomes impossible or
8 	    	 ISDA ® 2002
impracticable for such Office so to perform, receive or comply (or it would be impossible or impracticable for such Office so to perform, receive or comply if such payment, delivery or compliance were required on that day); or
(2) such party or any Credit Support Provider of such party (which will be the Affected Party) is prevented from performing any absolute or contingent obligation to make a payment or delivery which such party or Credit Support Provider has under any Credit Support Document relating to such Transaction, from receiving a payment or delivery under such Credit Support Document or from complying with any other material provision of such Credit Support Document (or would be so prevented if such payment, delivery or compliance were required on that day), or it becomes impossible or impracticable for such party or Credit Support Provider so to perform, receive or comply (or it would be impossible or impracticable for such party or Credit Support Provider so to perform, receive or comply if such payment, delivery or compliance were required on that day),
so long as the force majeure or act of state is beyond the control of such Office, such party or such Credit Support Provider, as appropriate, and such Office, party or Credit Support Provider could not, after using all reasonable efforts (which will not require such party or Credit Support Provider to incur a loss, other than immaterial, incidental expenses), overcome such prevention, impossibility or impracticability;
(iii) Tax Event. Due to (1) any action taken by a taxing authority, or brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, after a Transaction is entered into (regardless of whether such action is taken or brought with respect to a party to this Agreement) or (2) a Change in Tax Law, the party (which will be the Affected Party) will, or there is a substantial likelihood that it will, on the next succeeding Scheduled Settlement Date (A) be required to pay to the other party an additional amount in respect of an Indemnifiable Tax under Section 2(d)(i)(4) (except in respect of interest under Section 9(h)) or (B) receive a payment from which an amount is required to be deducted or withheld for or on account of a Tax (except in respect of interest under Section 9(h)) and no additional amount is required to be paid in respect of such Tax under Section 2(d)(i)(4) (other than by reason of Section 2(d)(i)(4)(A) or (B));
(iv) Tax Event Upon Merger. The party (the "Burdened Party") on the next succeeding Scheduled Settlement Date will either (1) be required to pay an additional amount in respect of an Indemnifiable Tax under Section 2(d)(i)(4) (except in respect of interest under Section 9(h)) or (2) receive a payment from which an amount has been deducted or withheld for or on account of any Tax in respect of which the other party is not required to pay an additional amount (other than by reason of Section 2(d)(i)(4)(A) or (B)), in either case as a result of a party consolidating or amalgamating with, or merging with or into, or transferring all or substantially all its assets (or any substantial part of the assets comprising the business conducted by it as of the date of this Master Agreement) to, or reorganising, reincorporating or reconstituting into or as, another entity (which will be the Affected Party) where such action does not constitute a Merger Without Assumption;
(v) Credit Event Upon Merger. If "Credit Event Upon Merger" is specified in the Schedule as applying to the party, a Designated Event (as defined below) occurs with respect to such party, any Credit Support Provider of such party or any applicable Specified Entity of such party (in each case, "X") and such Designated Event does not constitute a Merger Without Assumption, and the creditworthiness of X or, if applicable, the successor, surviving or transferee entity of X, after taking into account any applicable Credit Support Document, is materially weaker immediately after the occurrence of such Designated Event than that of X immediately prior to the occurrence of such Designated Event (and, in any such event, such party or its successor, surviving or transferee entity, as appropriate, will be the Affected Party). A "Designated Event" with respect to X means that:--
(1) X consolidates or amalgamates with, or merges with or into, or transfers all or substantially all its assets (or any substantial part of the assets comprising the business conducted by X as of the
9 	    	 ISDA ® 2002
date of this Master Agreement) to, or reorganises, reincorporates or reconstitutes into or as, another entity;
(2) any person, related group of persons or entity acquires directly or indirectly the beneficial ownership of (A) equity securities having the power to elect a majority of the board of directors (or its equivalent) of X or (B) any other ownership interest enabling it to exercise control of X; or
(3) X effects any substantial change in its capital structure by means of the issuance, incurrence or guarantee of debt or the issuance of (A) preferred stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for debt or preferred stock or (B) in the case of entities other than corporations, any other form of ownership interest; or
(vi) Additional Termination Event. If any "Additional Termination Event" is specified in the Schedule or any Confirmation as applying, the occurrence of such event (and, in such event, the Affected Party or Affected Parties will be as specified for such Additional Termination Event in the Schedule or such Confirmation).
(c) Hierarchy of Events.
(i) An event or circumstance that constitutes or gives rise to an Illegality or a Force Majeure Event will not, for so long as that is the case, also constitute or give rise to an Event of Default under Section 5(a)(i), 5(a)(ii)(1) or 5(a)(iii)(1) insofar as such event or circumstance relates to the failure to make any payment or delivery or a failure to comply with any other material provision of this Agreement or a Credit Support Document, as the case may be.
(ii) Except in circumstances contemplated by clause (i) above, if an event or circumstance which would otherwise constitute or give rise to an Illegality or a Force Majeure Event also constitutes an Event of Default or any other Termination Event, it will be treated as an Event of Default or such other Termination Event, as the case may be, and will not constitute or give rise to an Illegality or a Force Majeure Event.
(iii) If an event or circumstance which would otherwise constitute or give rise to a Force Majeure Event also constitutes an Illegality, it will be treated as an Illegality, except as described in clause (ii) above, and not a Force Majeure Event.
(d) Deferral of Payments and Deliveries During Waiting Period. If an Illegality or a Force Majeure Event has occurred and is continuing with respect to a Transaction, each payment or delivery which would otherwise be required to be made under that Transaction will be deferred to, and will not be due until:--
(i) the first Local Business Day or, in the case of a delivery, the first Local Delivery Day (or the first day that would have been a Local Business Day or Local Delivery Day, as appropriate, but for the occurrence of the event or circumstance constituting or giving rise to that Illegality or Force Majeure Event) following the end of any applicable Waiting Period in respect of that Illegality or Force Majeure Event, as the case may be; or
(ii) if earlier, the date on which the event or circumstance constituting or giving rise to that Illegality or Force Majeure Event ceases to exist or, if such date is not a Local Business Day or, in the case of a delivery, a Local Delivery Day, the first following day that is a Local Business Day or Local Delivery Day, as appropriate.
(e) Inability of Head or Home Office to Perform Obligations of Branch. If
(i) an Illegality or a Force Majeure Event occurs under Section 5(b)(i)(1) or 5(b)(ii)(1) and the relevant Office is not the Affected Party's head or home office, (ii) Section 10(a) applies, (iii) the other party seeks performance of the relevant obligation or
10 	    	 ISDA® 2002
compliance with the relevant provision by the Affected Party's head or home office and (iv) the Affected Party's head or home office fails so to perform or comply due to the occurrence of an event or circumstance which would, if that head or home office were the Office through which the Affected Party makes and receives payments and deliveries with respect to the relevant Transaction, constitute or give rise to an Illegality or a Force Majeure Event, and such failure would otherwise constitute an Event of Default under Section 5(a)(i) or 5(a)(iii)(1) with respect to such party, then, for so long as the relevant event or circumstance continues to exist with respect to both the Office referred to in Section 5(b)(i)(1) or 5(b)(ii)(1), as the case may be, and the Affected Party's head or home office, such failure will not constitute an Event of Default under Section 5(a)(i) or 5(a)(iii)(1).
6. 	  Early Termination; Close-Out Netting
(a) Right to Terminate Following Event of Default. If at any time an Event of Default with respect to a party (the "Defaulting Party") has occurred and is then continuing, the other party (the "Non-defaulting Party") may, by not more than 20 days notice to the Defaulting Party specifying the relevant Event of Default, designate a day not earlier than the day such notice is effective as an Early Termination Date in respect of all outstanding Transactions. If, however, "Automatic Early Termination" is specified in the Schedule as applying to a party, then an Early Termination Date in respect of all outstanding Transactions will occur immediately upon the occurrence with respect to such party of an Event of Default specified in Section 5(a)(vii)(l), (3), (5), (6) or, to the extent analogous thereto, (8), and as of the time immediately preceding the institution of the relevant proceeding or the presentation of the relevant petition upon the occurrence with respect to such party of an Event of Default specified in Section 5(a)(vii)(4) or, to the extent analogous thereto, (8).
(b) 	  Right to Terminate Following Termination Event.
(i) Notice. If a Termination Event other than a Force Majeure Event occurs, an Affected Party will, promptly upon becoming aware of it, notify the other party, specifying the nature of that Termination Event and each Affected Transaction, and will also give the other party such other information about that Termination Event as the other party may reasonably require. If a Force Majeure Event occurs, each party will, promptly upon becoming aware of it, use all reasonable efforts to notify the other party, specifying the nature of that Force Majeure Event, and will also give the other party such other information about that Force Majeure Event as the other party may reasonably require.
(ii) Transfer to Avoid Termination Event. If a Tax Event occurs and there is only one Affected Party, or if a Tax Event Upon Merger occurs and the Burdened Party is the Affected Party, the Affected Party will, as a condition to its right to designate an Early Termination Date under Section 6(b)(iv), use all reasonable efforts (which will not require such party to incur a loss, other than immaterial, incidental expenses) to transfer within 20 days after it gives notice under Section 6(b)(i) all its rights and obligations under this Agreement in respect of the Affected Transactions to another of its Offices or Affiliates so that such Termination Event ceases to exist.
If the Affected Party is not able to make such a transfer it will give notice to the other party to that effect within such 20 day period, whereupon the other party may effect such a transfer within 30 days after the notice is given under Section 6(b)(i).
Any such transfer by a party under this Section 6(b)(ii) will be subject to and conditional upon the prior written consent of the other party, which consent will not be withheld if such other party's policies in effect at such time would permit it to enter into transactions with the transferee on the terms proposed.
(iii) Two Affected Parties. If a Tax Event occurs and there are two Affected Parties, each party will use all reasonable efforts to reach agreement within 30 days after notice of such occurrence is given under Section 6(b)(i) to avoid that Termination Event.

(iv) Right to Terminate.
(1) 	  If:----
(A) a transfer under Section 6(b)(ii) or an agreement under Section 6(b)(iii), as the case may be, has not been effected with respect to all Affected Transactions within 30 days after an Affected Party gives notice under Section 6(b)(i); or
(B) a Credit Event Upon Merger or an Additional Termination Event occurs, or a Tax Event Upon Merger occurs and the Burdened Party is not the Affected Party,
the Burdened Party in the case of a Tax Event Upon Merger, any Affected Party in the case of a Tax Event or an Additional Termination Event if there are two Affected Parties, or the Non-affected Party in the case of a Credit Event Upon Merger or an Additional Termination Event if there is only one Affected Party may, if the relevant Termination Event is then continuing, by not more than 20 days notice to the other party, designate a day not earlier than the day such notice is effective as an Early Termination Date in respect of all Affected Transactions.
(2) If at any time an Illegality or a Force Majeure Event has occurred and is then continuing and any applicable Waiting Period has expired:--
(A) Subject to clause (B) below, either party may, by not more than 20 days notice to the other party, designate (I) a day not earlier than the day on which such notice becomes effective as an Early Termination Date in respect of all Affected Transactions or (II) by specifying in that notice the Affected Transactions in respect of which it is designating the relevant day as an Early Termination Date, a day not earlier than two Local Business Days following the day on which such notice becomes effective as an Early Termination Date in respect of less than all Affected Transactions. Upon receipt of a notice designating an Early Termination Date in respect of less than all Affected Transactions, the other party may, by notice to the designating party, if such notice is effective on or before the day so designated, designate that same day as an Early Termination Date in respect of any or all other Affected Transactions.
(B) An Affected Party (if the Illegality or Force Majeure Event relates to performance by such party or any Credit Support Provider of such party of an obligation to make any payment or delivery under, or to compliance with any other material provision of, the relevant Credit Support Document) will only have the right to designate an Early Termination Date under Section 6(b)(iv)(2)(A) as a result of an Illegality under Section 5(b)(i)(2) or a Force Majeure Event under Section 5(b)(ii)(2) following the prior designation by the other party of an Early Termination Date, pursuant to Section 6(b)(iv)(2)(A), in respect of less than all Affected Transactions.
(c) Effect of Designation.
(i) If notice designating an Early Termination Date is given under Section 6(a) or 6(b), the Early Termination Date will occur on the date so designated, whether or not the relevant Event of Default or Termination Event is then continuing.
(ii) Upon the occurrence or effective designation of an Early Termination Date, no further payments or deliveries under Section 2(a)(i) or 9(h)(i) in respect of the Terminated Transactions will be required to be made, but without prejudice to the other provisions of this Agreement. The amount, if any, payable in respect of an Early Termination Date will be determined pursuant to Sections 6(e) and 9(h)(ii).
12 	    	 ISDA ® 2002
(d) Calculations; Payment Date.
(i) Statement. On or as soon as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of an Early Termination Date, each party will make the calculations on its part, if any, contemplated by Section 6(e) and will provide to the other party a statement (1) showing, in reasonable detail, such calculations (including any quotations, market data or information from internal sources used in making such calculations), (2) specifying (except where there are two Affected Parties) any Early Termination Amount payable and (3) giving details of the relevant account to which any amount payable to it is to be paid. In the absence of written confirmation from the source of a quotation or market data obtained in determining a Close-out Amount, the records of the party obtaining such quotation or market data will be conclusive evidence of the existence and accuracy of such quotation or market data.
(ii) Payment Date. An Early Termination Amount due in respect of any Early Termination Date will, together with any amount of interest payable pursuant to Section 9(h)(ii)(2), be payable (1) on the day on which notice of the amount payable is effective in the case of an Early Termination Date which is designated or occurs as a result of an Event of Default and (2) on the day which is two Local Business Days after the day on which notice of the amount payable is effective (or, if there are two Affected Parties, after the day on which the statement provided pursuant to clause (i) above by the second party to provide such a statement is effective) in the case of an Early Termination Date which is designated as a result of a Termination Event.
(e) Payments on Early Termination. If an Early Termination Date occurs, the amount, if any, payable in respect of that Early Termination Date (the "Early Termination Amount") will be determined pursuant to this Section 6(e) and will be subject to Section 6(f).
(i) Events of Default. If the Early Termination Date results from an Event of Default, the Early Termination Amount will be an amount equal to (1) the sum of (A) the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Close-out Amount or Close-out Amounts (whether positive or negative) determined by the Non- defaulting Party for each Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions, as the case may be, and (B) the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to the Non-defaulting Party less (2) the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to the Defaulting Party. If the Early Termination Amount is a positive number, the Defaulting Party will pay it to the Non-defaulting Party; if it is a negative number, the Non-defaulting Party will pay the absolute value of the Early Termination Amount to the Defaulting Party.
(ii) Termination Events. If the Early Termination Date results from a Termination Event:--
(1) One Affected Party. Subject to clause (3) below, if there is one Affected Party, the Early Termination Amount will be determined in accordance with Section 6(e)(i), except that references to the Defaulting Party and to the Non-defaulting Party will be deemed to be references to the Affected Party and to the Non-affected Party, respectively.
(2) Two Affected Parties. Subject to clause (3) below, if there are two Affected Parties, each party will determine an amount equal to the Termination Currency Equivalent of the sum of the Close-out Amount or Close-out Amounts (whether positive or negative) for each Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions, as the case may be, and the Early Termination Amount will be an amount equal to (A) the sum of (I) one-half of the difference between the higher amount so determined (by party "X") and the lower amount so determined (by party "Y") and (II) the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to X less (B)  the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to Y. If the Early Termination Amount is a positive number, Y will pay it to X; if it is a negative number, X will pay the absolute value of the Early Termination Amount to Y.
13 	    	 ISDA ® 2002
(3) Mid-Market Events. If that Termination Event is an Illegality or a Force Majeure Event, then the Early Termination Amount will be determined in accordance with clause (1) or (2) above, as appropriate, except that, for the purpose of determining a Close-out Amount or Close-out Amounts, the Determining Party will:--
(A) if obtaining quotations from one or more third parties (or from any of the Determining Party's Affiliates), ask each third party or Affiliate (I) not to take account of the current creditworthiness of the Determining Party or any existing Credit Support Document and (II) to provide mid-market quotations; and
(B) in any other case, use mid-market values without regard to the creditworthiness of the Determining Party.
(iii) Adjustment for Bankruptcy. In circumstances where an Early Termination Date occurs because "Automatic Early Termination" applies in respect of a party, the Early Termination Amount will be subject to such adjustments as are appropriate and permitted by applicable law to reflect any payments or deliveries made by one party to the other under this Agreement (and retained by such other party) during the period from the relevant Early Termination Date to the date for payment determined under Section 6(d)(ii).
(iv) Adjustment for Illegality or Force Majeure Event. The failure by a party or any Credit Support Provider of such party to pay, when due, any Early Termination Amount will not constitute an Event of Default under Section 5(a)(i) or 5(a)(iii)(1) if such failure is due to the occurrence of an event or circumstance which would, if it occurred with respect to payment, delivery or compliance related to a Transaction, constitute or give rise to an Illegality or a Force Majeure Event. Such amount will (1) accrue interest and otherwise be treated as an Unpaid Amount owing to the other party if subsequently an Early Termination Date results from an Event of Default, a Credit Event Upon Merger or an Additional Termination Event in respect of which all outstanding Transactions are Affected Transactions and (2) otherwise accrue interest in accordance with Section 9(h)(ii)(2).
(v) Pre-Estimate. The parties agree that an amount recoverable under this Section 6(e) is a reasonable pre-estimate of loss and not a penalty. Such amount is payable for the loss of bargain and the loss of protection against future risks, and, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, neither party will be entitled to recover any additional damages as a consequence of the termination of the Terminated Transactions.
(f) Set-Off Any Early Termination Amount payable to one party (the "Payee") by the other party (the "Payer"), in circumstances where there is a Defaulting Party or where there is one Affected Party in the case where either a Credit Event Upon Merger has occurred or any other Termination Event in respect of which all outstanding Transactions are Affected Transactions has occurred, will, at the option of the Non-defaulting Party or the Non-affected Party, as the case may be ("X") (and without prior notice to the Defaulting Party or the Affected Party, as the case may be), be reduced by its set-off against any other amounts ("Other Amounts") payable by the Payee to the Payer (whether or not arising under this Agreement, matured or contingent and irrespective of the currency, place of payment or place of booking of the obligation). To the extent that any Other Amounts are so set off, those Other Amounts will be discharged promptly and in all respects. X will give notice to the other party of any set-off effected under this Section 6(f).
For this purpose, either the Early Termination Amount or the Other Amounts (or the relevant portion of such amounts) may be converted by X into the currency in which the other is denominated at the rate of exchange at which such party would be able, in good faith and using commercially reasonable procedures, to purchase the relevant amount of such currency.
14 	    	 ISDA® 2002
If an obligation is unascertained, X may in good faith estimate that obligation and set off in respect of the estimate, subject to the relevant party accounting to the other when the obligation is ascertained.
Nothing in this Section 6(f) will be effective to create a charge or other security interest. This Section 6(f) will be without prejudice and in addition to any right of set-off, offset, combination of accounts, lien, right of retention or withholding or similar right or requirement to which any party is at any time otherwise entitled or subject (whether by operation of law, contract or otherwise).
7. 	  Transfer
Subject to Section 6(b)(ii) and to the extent permitted by applicable law, neither this Agreement nor any interest or obligation in or under this Agreement may be transferred (whether by way of security or otherwise) by either party without the prior written consent of the other party, except that:--
(a) a party may make such a transfer of this Agreement pursuant to a consolidation or amalgamation with, or merger with or into, or transfer of all or substantially all its assets to, another entity (but without prejudice to any other right or remedy under this Agreement); and
(b) a party may make such a transfer of all or any part of its interest in any Early Termination Amount payable to it by a Defaulting Party, together with any amounts payable on or with respect to that interest and any other rights associated with that interest pursuant to Sections 8, 9(h) and 11.
Any purported transfer that is not in compliance with this Section 7 will be void.
8. 	  Contractual Currency
(a) Payment in the Contractual Currency. Each payment under this Agreement will be made in the relevant currency specified in this Agreement for that payment (the "Contractual Currency"). To the extent permitted by applicable law, any obligation to make payments under this Agreement in the Contractual Currency will not be discharged or satisfied by any tender in any currency other than the Contractual Currency, except to the extent such tender results in the actual receipt by the party to which payment is owed, acting in good faith and using commercially reasonable procedures in converting the currency so tendered into the Contractual Currency, of the full amount in the Contractual Currency of all amounts payable in respect of this Agreement. If for any reason the amount in the Contractual Currency so received falls short of the amount in the Contractual Currency payable in respect of this Agreement, the party required to make the payment will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, immediately pay such additional amount in the Contractual Currency as may be necessary to compensate for the shortfall. If for any reason the amount in the Contractual Currency so received exceeds the amount in the Contractual Currency payable in respect of this Agreement, the party receiving the payment will refund promptly the amount of such excess.
(b) Judgments. To the extent permitted by applicable law, if any judgment or order expressed in a currency other than the Contractual Currency is rendered (i) for the payment of any amount owing in respect of this Agreement, (ii) for the payment of any amount relating to any early termination in respect of this Agreement or (iii) in respect of a judgment or order of another court for the payment of any amount described in clause (i) or (ii) above, the party seeking recovery, after recovery in full of the aggregate amount to which such party is entitled pursuant to the judgment or order, will be entitled to receive immediately from the other party the amount of any shortfall of the Contractual Currency received by such party as a consequence of sums paid in such other currency and will refund promptly to the other party any excess of the Contractual Currency received by such party as a consequence of sums paid in such other currency if such shortfall or such excess arises or results from any variation between the rate of exchange at which the Contractual Currency is converted into the currency of the judgment or order for the purpose of such judgment or order and the rate of exchange at which such party is able, acting in good faith and using
15 	    	 ISDA ® 2002
commercially reasonable procedures in converting the currency received into the Contractual Currency, to purchase the Contractual Currency with the amount of the currency of the judgment or order actually received by such party.
(c) Separate Indemnities. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the indemnities in this Section 8 constitute separate and independent obligations from the other obligations in this Agreement, will be enforceable as separate and independent causes of action, will apply notwithstanding any indulgence granted by the party to which any payment is owed and will not be affected by judgment being obtained or claim or proof being made for any other sums payable in respect of this Agreement.
(d) Evidence of Loss. For the purpose of this Section 8, it will be sufficient for a party to demonstrate that it would have suffered a loss had an actual exchange or purchase been made.
9. 	  Miscellaneous
(a) Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding of the parties with respect to its subject matter. Each of the parties acknowledges that in entering into this Agreement it has not relied on any oral or written representation, warranty or other assurance (except as provided for or referred to in this Agreement) and waives all rights and remedies which might otherwise be available to it in respect thereof, except that nothing in this Agreement will limit or exclude any liability of a party for fraud.
(b) Amendments. An amendment, modification or waiver in respect of this Agreement will only be effective if in writing (including a writing evidenced by a facsimile transmission) and executed by each of the parties or confirmed by an exchange of telexes or by an exchange of electronic messages on an electronic messaging system.
(c) Survival of Obligations. Without prejudice to Sections 2(a)(iii) and 6(c)(ii), the obligations of the parties under this Agreement will survive the termination of any Transaction.

The parties will specify therein or through another effective means that any such counterpart, telex, electronic message or e-mail constitutes a Confirmation.
(f) No Waiver of Rights. A failure or delay in exercising any right, power or privilege in respect of this Agreement will not be presumed to operate as a waiver, and a single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege will not be presumed to preclude any subsequent or further exercise, of that right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

If a party defaults in the performance of any payment obligation, it will, to the extent permitted by applicable law and subject to Section 6(c), pay interest (before as well as after judgment) on the overdue amount to the other party on demand in the same currency as the overdue amount, for the period from (and including) the original due date for payment to (but excluding) the date of actual payment (and excluding any period in respect of which interest or compensation in respect of the overdue amount is due pursuant to clause (3)(B) or (C) below), at the Default Rate.

The fair market value of any obligation referred to above will be determined as of the originally scheduled date for delivery, in good faith and using commercially reasonable procedures, by the party that was entitled to take delivery.
(3) Interest on Deferred Payments. If:--
(A) a party does not pay any amount that, but for Section 2(a)(iii), would have been payable, it will, to the extent permitted by applicable law and subject to Section 6(c) and clauses (B) and (C) below, pay interest (before as well as after judgment) on that amount to the other party on demand (after such amount becomes payable) in the same currency as that amount, for the period from (and including) the date the amount would, but for Section 2(a)(iii), have been payable to (but excluding) the date the amount actually becomes payable, at the Applicable Deferral Rate;
(B) a payment is deferred pursuant to Section 5(d), the party which would otherwise have been required to make that payment will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, subject to Section 6(c) and for so long as no Event of Default or Potential Event of Default with respect to that party has occurred and is continuing, pay interest (before as well as after judgment) on the amount of the deferred payment to the other party on demand (after such amount becomes payable) in the same currency as the deferred payment, for the period from (and including) the date the amount would, but for Section 5(d), have been payable to (but excluding) the earlier of the date the payment is no longer deferred pursuant to Section 5(d) and the date during the deferral period upon which an Event of Default or Potential Event of Default with respect to that party occurs, at the Applicable Deferral Rate; or
(C) a party fails to make any payment due to the occurrence of an Illegality or a Force Majeure Event (after giving effect to any deferral period contemplated by clause (B) above), it will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, subject to Section 6(c) and for so long as the event or circumstance giving rise to that Illegality or Force Majeure Event
17 	    	 ISDA® 2002
continues and no Event of Default or Potential Event of Default with respect to that party has occurred and is continuing, pay interest (before as well as after judgment) on the overdue amount to the other party on demand in the same currency as the overdue amount, for the period from (and including) the date the party fails to make the payment due to the occurrence of the relevant Illegality or Force Majeure Event (or, if later, the date the payment is no longer deferred pursuant to Section 5(d)) to (but excluding) the earlier of the date the event or circumstance giving rise to that Illegality or Force Majeure Event ceases to exist and the date during the period upon which an Event of Default or Potential Event of Default with respect to that party occurs (and excluding any period in respect of which interest or compensation in respect of the overdue amount is due pursuant to clause (B) above), at the Applicable Deferral Rate.

(ii) Early Termination. Upon the occurrence or effective designation of an Early Termination Date in respect of a Transaction:--
(1 ) Unpaid Amounts. For the purpose of determining an Unpaid Amount in respect of the relevant Transaction, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, interest will accrue on the amount of any payment obligation or the amount equal to the fair market value of any obligation required to be settled by delivery included in such determination in the same currency as that amount, for the period from (and including) the date the relevant obligation was (or would have been but for Section 2(a)(iii) or 5(d)) required to have been performed to (but excluding) the relevant Early Termination Date, at the Applicable Close-out Rate.
(2) Interest on Early Termination Amounts. If an Early Termination Amount is due in respect of such Early Termination Date, that amount will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be paid together with interest (before as well as after judgment) on that amount in the Termination Currency, for the period from (and including) such Early Termination Date to (but excluding) the date the amount is paid, at the Applicable Close-out Rate.
(iii) Interest Calculation. Any interest pursuant to this Section 9(h) will be calculated on the basis of daily compounding and the actual number of days elapsed.
18 	    	 ISDA ® 2002
10. 	  Offices; Multibranch Parties
(a) If Section 10(a) is specified in the Schedule as applying, each party that enters into a Transaction through an Office other than its head or home office represents to and agrees with the other party that, notwithstanding the place of booking or its jurisdiction of incorporation or organisation, its obligations are the same in terms of recourse against it as if it had entered into the Transaction through its head or home office, except that a party will not have recourse to the head or home office of the other party in respect of any payment or delivery deferred pursuant to Section 5(d) for so long as the payment or delivery is so deferred. This representation and agreement will be deemed to be repeated by each party on each date on which the parties enter into a Transaction.
(b) If a party is specified as a Multibranch Party in the Schedule, such party may, subject to clause (c) below, enter into a Transaction through, book a Transaction in and make and receive payments and deliveries with respect to a Transaction through any Office listed in respect of that party in the Schedule (but not any other Office unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing).
(c) The Office through which a party enters into a Transaction will be the Office specified for that party in the relevant Confirmation or as otherwise agreed by the parties in writing, and, if an Office for that party is not specified in the Confirmation or otherwise agreed by the parties in writing, its head or home office. Unless the parties otherwise agree in writing, the Office through which a party enters into a Transaction will also be the Office in which it books the Transaction and the Office through which it makes and receives payments and deliveries with respect to the Transaction. Subject to Section 6(b)(ii), neither party may change the Office in which it books the Transaction or the Office through which it makes and receives payments or deliveries with respect to a Transaction without the prior written consent of the other party.
11. 	  Expenses
A Defaulting Party will on demand indemnify and hold harmless the other party for and against all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including legal fees, execution fees and Stamp Tax, incurred by such other party by reason of the enforcement and protection of its rights under this Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which the Defaulting Party is a party or by reason of the early termination of any Transaction, including, but not limited to, costs of collection.
12. 	  Notices
(a) Effectiveness. Any notice or other communication in respect of this Agreement may be given in any manner described below (except that a notice or other communication under Section 5 or 6 may not be given by electronic messaging system or e-mail) to the address or number or in accordance with the electronic messaging system or e-mail details provided (see the Schedule) and will be deemed effective as indicated:--

unless the date of that delivery (or attempted delivery) or that receipt, as applicable, is not a Local Business Day or that communication is delivered (or attempted) or received, as applicable, after the close of business on a Local Business Day, in which case that communication will be deemed given and effective on the first following day that is a Local Business Day.
(b) Change of Details. Either party may by notice to the other change the address, telex or facsimile number or electronic messaging system or e-mail details at which notices or other communications are to be given to it.
13. 	  Governing Law and Jurisdiction
(a) Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the law specified in the Schedule.
(b) Jurisdiction. With respect to any suit, action or proceedings relating to any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement ("Proceedings"), each party irrevocably:--
(i) submits:--
(1) if this Agreement is expressed to be governed by English law, to (A) the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts if the Proceedings do not involve a Convention Court and (B) the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts if the Proceedings do involve a Convention Court; or

(iii) agrees, to the extent permitted by applicable law, that the bringing of Proceedings in any one or more jurisdictions will not preclude the bringing of Proceedings in any other jurisdiction.
(c) Service of Process. Each party irrevocably appoints the Process Agent, if any. specified opposite its name in the Schedule to receive, for it and on its behalf, service of process in any Proceedings. If for any reason any party's Process Agent is unable to act as such, such party will promptly notify the other party and within 30 days appoint a substitute process agent acceptable to the other party. The parties irrevocably consent to service of process given in the manner provided for notices in Section 12(a)(i), 12(a)(iii) or l2(a)(iv). Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of either party to serve process in any other manner permitted by applicable law.
(d) Waiver of Immunities.

(ii) The procedure set forth in this subpart (ii) is applicable to all Transactions except Credit Derivative Transactions (as defined in the 2003 ISDA Credit Derivatives Definitions) (or any successor ISDA publication to such definitions) and Non-Disputable Equity Derivatives Transactions). Unless otherwise agreed in a global master confirmation agreement between the parties, a "Non-Disputable Equity Derivatives Transaction" means any Transaction in respect of which (y) the relevant Confirmation incorporates the 2002 ISDA Equity Derivatives Definitions (or any successor ISDA publication to such definitions) and (z) one or more of the Exchanges is located (A) in any of Bahrain, Czech Republic, Egypt, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco, Oman, Poland, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey or the United Arab Emirates, (B) anywhere in Asia other than Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, New Zealand or Singapore or (C) anywhere in Latin America other than Brazil.
A party (the " Objecting Party") has the right to dispute in good faith and on commercially reasonable grounds a particular Determination made by the Calculation Agent, provided that the Objecting Party notifies the other party and the Calculation Agent (if the other party is not the Calculation Agent) of such dispute promptly (but in no event later than one Reference Day) after the Calculation Agent has provided the Objecting Party and the other party (if the other party is not the Calculation Agent) with notice of such Determination.
In any such instance, the parties shall, within three Reference Days after such notice, jointly select three Independent Dealers (or, if the parties cannot jointly agree on three, each party shall select an Independent Dealer, which two Independent Dealers shall jointly select a third Independent Dealer). Each such Independent Dealer shall be requested by the Calculation Agent to make a Determination as to the disputed matter within three Reference Days after its appointment.
In the event that two or three Independent Dealers provide a Determination as to the disputed matter within three Reference Days after their respective appointments:
(y) 	  if those Determinations are susceptible to the calculation of an arithmetic mean, the arithmetic mean of such Determinations shall be binding on the parties for the disputed matter, absent manifest error; or
(z) 	  if those Determinations are not susceptible to the calculation of an arithmetic mean (e.g., Determinations as to whether or not an event has occurred or terms of a Transaction are to be adjusted), then (A) if a majority of the responding Independent Dealers provided the same Determination, such Determination shall be binding on the parties for the disputed matter, absent manifest error, or (B) if a majority of the Independent Dealers did not provide the same Determination, the responding Independent Dealers will jointly appoint a fourth Independent Dealer (the "Resolver"). The Resolver will select, within two Reference Days after its appointment, from the Determinations originally provided by the responding Independent Dealers,
with the selected Determination being binding on the parties for the disputed matter, absent manifest error.
The costs of any Independent Dealers or Resolver shall be borne by (x) the Objecting Party if the Determination made pursuant to this subpart (ii) substantially comports with the relevant Determination made by the Calculation Agent or if the relevant Determination made by the Calculation Agent otherwise applies, (y) Party B if Party B disputes a Determination made by a Calculation Agent selected by Party B, or (z) Party A, if Party A is the Calculation Agent and the Determination made pursuant to this subpart (ii) does not substantially comport with the relevant Determination made by the Calculation Agent.
The following terms used in this Part 5(6) have the following meanings:
"Determination" means any determination, calculation, or adjustment, as the case may be.
"Independent Dealer" means a leading dealer in the relevant market that is not an Affiliate of either of the parties or any other appointed Independent Dealer.
"Reference Day" means, in respect of any Transaction, a Business Day as defined as set forth in the Confirmation evidencing such Transaction or, absent such definition, a day that is a Banking Day (as defined in the 2006 ISDA Definitions) in New York and in the location of the office of Party A where such Transaction is booked.
(iii) A party's right to dispute a Determination under subpart (ii) immediately above shall (1) cease to be applicable at any time that a Potential Event of Default or Event of Default in respect of such party or an Additional Termination Event in respect of which such party is the sole Affected Party has occurred and is continuing, (2) be inapplicable in respect of any Transaction for which the relevant Confirmation or Master Confirmation sets forth procedures for disputing a Determination by the Calculation Agent, and (3) be inapplicable to any Determination made pursuant to the terms of any Protocol sponsored by ISDA to which the parties adhere. Notwithstanding a party's exercise of its right to dispute a Determination under subpart (ii) immediately above, any undisputed amounts or deliveries in respect of any Transaction shall be made by the relevant party as if no dispute existed.

(i) Unless the parties expressly agree in a Confirmation of a Deliverable FX Transaction that this subsection (i) shall be inapplicable to such Deliverable FX Transaction, the obligation of Party A to make a payment in respect of any Deliverable FX Transaction on a Settlement Date is subject to the condition precedent that Party B shall have first satisfied its obligation to make each payment under such Deliverable FX Transaction, subject to any applicable condition precedent and any applicable provisions of Article 5.
(ii) If the parties expressly agree in a Confirmation of a Deliverable FX Transaction that subsection (i) immediately above shall be inapplicable to such Deliverable FX Transaction, each party will pay, on the Settlement Date in respect of such Deliverable FX Transaction, the amount specified as payable by it in the related Confirmation, subject to any applicable condition precedent and any applicable provisions of Article 5.

(c) Discharge and Termination. Unless otherwise agreed, any Call or any Put written by a party will automatically be terminated and discharged, in whole or in part, as applicable, against a Call or a Put, respectively, written by the other party, such termination and discharge to occur automatically upon the payment in full of the last Premium payable in respect of such Currency Option Transactions; provided that such termination and discharge may only occur in respect of Currency Option Transactions:
(i) each being with respect to the same Put Currency and the same Call Currency;
(ii) each having the same Expiration Date and Expiration Time;
(iii) each being of the same style, i.e. either both being American style Currency Option Transactions or both being European style Currency Option Transactions;

(v) neither of which shall have been exercised by delivery of a Notice of Exercise; and
(vi) each having been transacted by the same pair of Offices of the Buyer and Seller.
and, upon the occurrence of such termination and discharge, neither party shall have any further obligation to the other party in respect of the relevant Currency Option Transactions or, as the case may be, parts thereof so terminated and discharged. In the case of a partial termination and discharge (i.e., where the relevant Currency Option Transactions are for different amounts of the Currency Pair), the remaining portion of the Currency Option Transaction which is partially discharged and terminated shall continue to be a Currency Option Transaction for all purposes of this Agreement, including this Section 3.4(c).

Unless
the parties expressly agree in a Confirmation of a Deliverable Currency Option Transaction that this sentence shall be inapplicable to such Deliverable Currency Option Transaction, Party A may, by notice to Party B before the Settlement Date of any Deliverable Currency Option Transaction, require that each party pay the USD Equivalent of the amount payable by under such Deliverable Currency Option Transaction. "USD Equivalent" means (i) if the relevant currency is U.S. dollars, the amount of U.S. dollars and (ii) if the relevant currency is not U.S. dollars, the equivalent in U.S. dollars of the amount of such currency as determined by Party A in a commercially reasonable manner based on market rates available to Party A at such time in the New York foreign exchange market (or, at the option of Party A, in the foreign exchange market of any other financial center which is then open for business).

The amount payable in respect of the termination of transactions governed by any such Other JPM Affiliate Agreement shall be determined in accordance with any applicable provisions thereof and, if there are no such applicable provisions, in the same manner as set forth in Section 6 of this Agreement as if the transactions governed by such other JPM Affiliate Agreement were Transactions governed by this Agreement.
(3) 	  Authorization to Transfer Funds. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other agreement, upon the occurrence and during the continuation of any event of default, default, termination event, or similar condition or event (however described) in respect of Party B under any JPM Affiliate Agreement, Party B authorizes each JPM Affiliate, in its sole discretion and without prior notice to Party B, to transfer or cause to be transferred any funds, securities and/or other property to, between, or among any accounts maintained by Party B with or among any JPM Affiliates.
(4) 	  Assignment. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any JPM Affiliate Agreement, upon the occurrence and during the continuation of any event of default, default, termination event, or similar condition or event (however described) in respect of Party B under any JPM Affiliate Agreement, Party B hereby consents and agrees that the rights and obligations of any JPM Affiliate in respect of any JPM Affiliate Agreement may be assigned to any other JPM Affiliate without the prior written consent of Party B.
(5) 	  Additional JPM Set Off Rights. Any amount payable by a JPM Affiliate to Party B in respect of the termination of all transactions governed by a JPM Affiliate Agreement as the result of the occurrence of any event of default, default, termination event, or similar condition or event (however described) in respect of Party B may, at the option of such JPM Affiliate (and without prior notice to Party B), be reduced by its set-off against any Other Agreement Amount (as hereinafter defined). As used herein, "Other Agreement Amount" shall mean any payment obligation of any description whatsoever (whether arising at such time or in the future or upon the occurrence of a contingency) by Party B to any JPM Affiliate (irrespective of the currency, place of payment or booking office of the obligation or whether the relevant party is legally or beneficially the holder of the obligation) arising under any agreement between Party B and any JPM Affiliate or any instrument or undertaking issued or executed or guaranteed by Party B to, or in favor of, any JPM Affiliate or any bond, note, or other debt instrument issued or guaranteed by Party B and owned or held beneficially by any JPM Affiliate as a result of the purchase thereof by or on behalf of any JPM Affiliate, whether directly from the issuer or in the secondary market; and the Other Agreement Amount will be discharged promptly and in all respects to the extent it is so set-off. The JPM Affiliate effecting any set-off pursuant to this section will give notice to Party B of any such set-off.
For this purpose, the Other Agreement Amount (or the relevant portion of such amounts) may be converted by the JPM Affiliate effecting the set-off into the currency in which the obligation of such JPM Affiliate is denominated at the rate of exchange at which such JPM Affiliate would be able, acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith, to purchase the relevant amount of
such currency. If an obligation is unascertained, a JPM Affiliate may in good faith estimate that obligation and set-off in respect of the estimate, subject to the relevant party accounting to the other when the obligation is ascertained. Nothing in this section shall be effective to create a charge or other security interest. This section shall be without prejudice and in addition to any right of set-off, combination of accounts, lien or other right to which any entity is at any time otherwise entitled (whether by operation of law, contract or otherwise).

In the event of any inconsistency between this Annex and the other provisions of this Schedule, this Annex will prevail, and in the event of any inconsistency between Paragraph 13 and the other provisions of this Annex, Paragraph 13 will prevail.
(b)     Secured Party and Pledgor. All references in this Annex to the "Secured Party" will be to either party when acting in that capacity and all corresponding references to the "Pledgor" will be to the other party when acting in that capacity; provided, however, that if Other Posted Support (VM) is held by a party to this Annex, all references herein to that party as the Secured Party with respect to that Other Posted Support (VM) will be to that party as the beneficiary thereof and will not subject that support or that party as the beneficiary thereof to provisions of law generally relating to security interests and secured parties.

Paragraph 2. Security Interest
Each party, as the Pledgor, hereby pledges to the other party, as the Secured Party, as security for its Obligations, and grants to the Secured Party a first priority continuing security interest in, lien on and right of Set-off against all Posted Collateral (VM) Transferred to or received by the Secured Party hereunder.

Paragraph 3. Credit Support Obligations
(a)    Delivery Amount (VM). Subject to Paragraphs 4 and 5, upon a demand made by the Secured Party on or promptly following a Valuation Date, if the Delivery Amount (VM) for that Valuation Date equals or exceeds the Pledgor's Minimum Transfer Amount, then the Pledgor will Transfer to the Secured Party Eligible Credit Support (VM) having a Value as of the date of Transfer at least equal to the applicable Delivery Amount (VM) (rounded pursuant to Paragraph 13). Unless otherwise specified in Paragraph 13, the _" Delivery Amount (VM)" _applicable to the Pledgor for any Valuation Date will equal the amount by which:
(i)    the Secured Party's Exposure exceeds
(ii)    the Value as of that Valuation Date of all Posted Credit Support (VM) held by the Secured Party.
(b) Return Amount (VM). Subject to Paragraphs 4 and 5, upon a demand made by the Pledgor on or promptly following a Valuation Date, if the Return Amount (VM) for that Valuation Date equals or exceeds the Secured Party's Minimum Transfer Amount, then the Secured Party will Transfer to the Pledgor Posted Credit Support (VM) specified by the Pledgor in that demand having a Value as of the date of Transfer as close as practicable to the applicable Return Amount (VM) (rounded pursuant to Paragraph 13). Unless otherwise specified in Paragraph 13, the " Return Amount" applicable to the Secured Party for any Valuation Date will equal the amount by which:
(i)    the Value as of that Valuation Date of all Posted Credit Support (VM) held by the Secured Party exceeds
(ii)    the Secured Party's Exposure.
Paragraph 4. Conditions Precedent, Transfer Timing, Calculations and Substitutions
(a)    Conditions Precedent. Unless otherwise specified in Paragraph 13, each Transfer obligation of the Pledgor under Paragraphs 3, 5 and 6(d) and of the Secured Party under Paragraphs 3, 4(d)(ii), 5, 6(d) and 11(h) is subject to the conditions precedent that:
(i)    no Event of Default, Potential Event of Default or Specified Condition has occurred and is continuing with respect to the other party; and
(ii)    no Early Termination Date for which any unsatisfied payment obligations exist has occurred or been designated as the result of an Event of Default or Specified Condition with respect to the other party.
(b)    Transfer Timing. Subject to Paragraphs 4(a) and 5 and unless otherwise specified in Paragraph 13, if a demand for the Transfer of Eligible Credit Support (VM) or Posted Credit Support (VM) is made by the Notification Time, then the relevant Transfer will be made not later than the close of business on the Regular Settlement Day; if a demand is made after the Notification Time, then the relevant Transfer will be made not later than the close of business on the next Local Business Day following the Regular Settlement Day.
(c)    Calculations. All calculations of Value and Exposure for purposes of Paragraphs 3 and 6(d) will be made by the Valuation Agent as of the Valuation Time; provided that the Valuation Agent may use, in the case of any calculation of (i) Value, Values most recently reasonably available for close of business in the relevant market for
2 	    	 ISDA ®2016
the relevant Eligible Credit Support (VM) as of the Valuation Time and (ii) Exposure, relevant information or data most recently reasonably available for close of business in the relevant market(s) as of the Valuation Time. The Valuation Agent will notify each party (or the other party, if the Valuation Agent is a party) of its calculations not later than the Notification Time on the Local Business Day following the applicable Valuation Date (or in the case of Paragraph 6(d), following the date of calculation).
(d) Substitutions.
(i) Unless otherwise specified in Paragraph 13, upon notice to the Secured Party specifying the items of Posted Credit Support (VM) to be exchanged, the Pledgor may, on any Local Business Day, Transfer to the Secured Party substitute Eligible Credit Support (VM) (the _" Substitute Credit Support (VM)"); _and
(ii) subject to Paragraph 4(a), the Secured Party will Transfer to the Pledgor the items of Posted Credit Support (VM) specified by the Pledgor in its notice not later than the Local Business Day following the date on which the Secured Party receives the Substitute Credit Support (VM), unless otherwise specified in Paragraph 13 (the " Substitution Date"); provided that the Secured Party will only be obligated to Transfer Posted Credit Support (VM) with a Value as of the date of Transfer of that Posted Credit Support (VM) equal to the Value as of that date of the Substitute Credit Support (VM).
Paragraph 5. Dispute Resolution
If a party (a " Disputing Party") disputes (I) the Valuation Agent's calculation of a Delivery Amount (VM) or a Return Amount (VM) or (II) the Value of any Transfer of Eligible Credit Support (VM) or Posted Credit Support (VM), then:
(i) the Disputing Party will notify the other party and the Valuation Agent (if the Valuation Agent is not the other party) not later than the close of business on (X) the date that the Transfer is due in respect of such Delivery Amount (VM) or Return Amount (VM) in the case of (I) above, or (Y) the Local Business Day following the date of Transfer in the case of (II) above,

(iii) the parties will consult with each other in an attempt to resolve the dispute, and
(iv) if they fail to resolve the dispute by the Resolution Time, then:
(A) In the case of a dispute involving a Delivery Amount (VM) or Return Amount (VM), unless otherwise specified in Paragraph 13, the Valuation Agent will recalculate the Exposure and the Value as of the Recalculation Date by:
(1) utilizing any calculations of Exposure for the Covered Transactions that the parties have agreed are not in dispute;
(2) (I) if this Agreement is a 1992 ISDA Master Agreement, calculating the Exposure for the Covered Transactions in dispute by seeking four actual quotations at mid-market from Reference Market-makers for purposes of calculating Market Quotation, and taking the arithmetic average of those obtained, or (II) if this Agreement is an ISDA 2002 Master Agreement or a 1992 ISDA Master Agreement in which the definition of Loss and/or Market Quotation has been amended (including where such amendment has occurred pursuant to the terms of a separate agreement or protocol) to reflect the definition of Close- out Amount from the pre-printed form of the ISDA 2002 Master Agreement as published by ISDA, calculating the Exposure for the Covered Transactions in dispute by seeking four actual quotations at mid-market from third parties for purposes of calculating the relevant Close-out Amount, and taking the arithmetic average of those obtained; provided that, in
3 	    	 ISDA®2016
either case, if four quotations are not available for a particular Covered Transaction, then fewer than four quotations may be used for that Covered Transaction, and if no quotations are available for a particular Covered Transaction, then the Valuation Agent's original calculations will be used for that Covered Transaction; and
(3) utilizing the procedures specified in Paragraph 13 for calculating the Value, if disputed, of Posted Credit Support (VM).
(B) In the case of a dispute involving the Value of any Transfer of Eligible Credit Support (VM) or Posted Credit Support (VM), the Valuation Agent will recalculate the Value as of the date of Transfer pursuant to Paragraph 13.
Following a recalculation pursuant to this Paragraph, the Valuation Agent will notify each party (or the other party, if the Valuation Agent is a party) not later than the Notification Time on the Local Business Day following the Resolution Time. The appropriate party will, upon demand following that notice by the Valuation Agent or a resolution pursuant to (iii) above and subject to Paragraphs 4(a) and 4(b), make the appropriate Transfer.
Paragraph 6. Holding and Using Posted Collateral (VM)
(a) Care of Posted Collateral (VM). Without limiting the Secured Party's rights under Paragraph 6(c), the Secured Party will exercise reasonable care to assure the safe custody of all Posted Collateral (VM) to the extent required by applicable law, and in any event the Secured Party will be deemed to have exercised reasonable care if it exercises at least the same degree of care as it would exercise with respect to its own property. Except as specified in the preceding sentence, the Secured Party will have no duty with respect to Posted Collateral (VM), including, without limitation, any duty to collect any Distributions, or enforce or preserve any rights pertaining thereto.
(b) Eligibility to Hold Posted Collateral (VM); Custodians (VM).
(i) General. Subject to the satisfaction of any conditions specified in Paragraph 13 for holding Posted Collateral (VM), the Secured Party will be entitled to hold Posted Collateral (VM) or to appoint an agent (a _" Custodian (VM)") _to hold Posted Collateral (VM) for the Secured Party. Upon notice by the Secured Party to the Pledgor of the appointment of a Custodian (VM), the Pledgor's obligations to make any Transfer will be discharged by making the Transfer to that Custodian (VM). The holding of Posted Collateral (VM) by a Custodian (VM) will be deemed to be the holding of that Posted Collateral (VM) by the Secured Party for which the Custodian (VM) is acting.
(ii) Failure to Satisfy Conditions. If the Secured Party or its Custodian (VM) fails to satisfy any conditions for holding Posted Collateral (VM), then upon a demand made by the Pledgor, the Secured Party will, not later than five Local Business Days after the demand, Transfer or cause its Custodian (VM) to Transfer all Posted Collateral (VM) held by it to a Custodian (VM) that satisfies those conditions or to the Secured Party if it satisfies those conditions.
(iii) Liability. The Secured Party will be liable for the acts or omissions of its Custodian (VM) to the same extent that the Secured Party would be liable hereunder for its own acts or omissions.
(c) Use of Posted Collateral (VM). Unless otherwise specified in Paragraph 13 and without limiting the rights and obligations of the parties under Paragraphs 3, 4(d)(ii), 5, 6(d) and 8, if the Secured Party is not a Defaulting Party or an Affected Party with respect to a Specified Condition and no Early Termination Date has occurred or been designated as the result of an Event of Default or Specified Condition with respect to the Secured Party, then the Secured Party will, notwithstanding Section 9-207 of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, have the right to:
(i) sell, pledge, rehypothecate, assign, invest, use, commingle or otherwise dispose of, or otherwise use in its business any Posted Collateral (VM) it holds, free from any claim or right of any nature whatsoever of the Pledgor, including any equity or right of redemption by the Pledgor; and
4 	    	 ISDA®2016
(ii) register any Posted Collateral (VM) in the name of the Secured Party, its Custodian (VM) or a nominee for either.
For purposes of the obligation to Transfer Eligible Credit Support (VM) or Posted Credit Support (VM) pursuant to Paragraphs 3 and 5 and any rights or remedies authorized under this Agreement, the Secured Party will be deemed to continue to hold all Posted Collateral (VM) and to receive Distributions made thereon, regardless of whether the Secured Party has exercised any rights with respect to any Posted Collateral (VM) pursuant to (i) or (ii) above.
(d) Distributions, Interest Amount (VM) and Interest Payment (VM).
(i) Distributions. Subject to Paragraph 4(a), if the Secured Party receives or is deemed to receive Distributions on a Local Business Day, it will Transfer to the Pledgor not later than the following Local Business Day any Distributions it receives or is deemed to receive to the extent that a Delivery Amount (VM) would not be created or increased by that Transfer, as calculated by the Valuation Agent (and the date of calculation will be deemed to be a Valuation Date for this purpose).
(ii) Interest Amount (VM) and Interest Payment (VM). Unless otherwise specified in Paragraph 13 and subject to Paragraph 4(a), in lieu of any interest, dividends or other amounts paid or deemed to have been paid with respect to Posted Collateral (VM) in the form of Cash (all of which may be retained by the Secured Party),
(A) if "Interest Transfer" is specified as applicable in Paragraph 13, the Interest Payer (VM) will Transfer to the Interest Payee (VM), at the times specified in Paragraph 13, the relevant Interest Payment (VM); provided that if "Interest Payment Netting" is specified as applicable in Paragraph 13:
(1) if the Interest Payer (VM) is entitled to demand a Delivery Amount (VM) or Return Amount (VM), in respect of the date such Interest Payment (VM) is required to be Transferred:
(a) 	  such Delivery Amount (VM) or Return Amount (VM) will be reduced (but not below zero) by such Interest Payment (VM); provided that, in case of such Return Amount (VM), if the amount of Posted Collateral (VM) which is comprised of Cash in the Base Currency is less than such Interest Payment (VM), such reduction will only be to the extent of the amount of such Cash which is Posted Collateral (VM) (the " Eligible Return Amount (VM)"); and
(b) 	  the Interest Payer (VM) will Transfer to the Interest Payee (VM) the amount of the excess, if any, of such Interest Payment (VM) over such Delivery Amount (VM) or Eligible Return Amount (VM), as applicable; and
(II) if under Paragraph 6(d)(ii)(A)(I)(a) a Delivery Amount (VM) is reduced (the amount of such reduction, the " Delivery Amount Reduction (VM)") or a Return Amount (VM) is reduced (the amount of such reduction, the _" Return Amount Reduction (VM)"), _then for purposes of determining Posted Collateral (VM), the Secured Party (a) will be deemed to have received an amount in Cash in the Base Currency equal to any Delivery Amount Reduction (VM), and such amount will constitute Posted Collateral (VM) in such Cash and will be subject to the security interest granted under Paragraph 2 or (b) will be deemed to have Transferred an amount in Cash in the Base Currency equal to any Return Amount Reduction (VM), as applicable, in each case on the day on which the relevant Interest Payment (VM) was due to be Transferred, as applicable; and
(B) if "Interest Adjustment" is specified as applicable in Paragraph 13, the Posted Collateral (VM) will be adjusted by the Secured Party, at the times specified in Paragraph 13, as follows:
(I) if the Interest Amount (VM) for an Interest Period is a positive number, the Interest Amount (VM) will constitute Posted Collateral (VM) in the form of Cash in the Base Currency and will be subject to the security interest granted under Paragraph 2; and
5 	    	 ISDA®2016
(II) if the Interest Amount (VM) for an Interest Period is a negative number and any Posted Collateral (VM) is in the form of Cash in the Base Currency, the Interest Amount (VM) will constitute a reduction of Posted Collateral (VM) in the form of such Cash in an amount (such amount, the _" Interest Adjustment Reduction Amount (VM)") _equal to the absolute value of the Interest Amount (VM); provided that if the amount of Posted Collateral (VM) which is comprised of such Cash is less than the Interest Adjustment Reduction Amount (VM), such reduction will only be to the extent of the amount of such Cash which is Posted Collateral (VM) and the Pledgor will be obligated to Transfer the remainder of the Interest Adjustment Reduction Amount (VM) to the Secured Party on the day that such reduction occurred.
Paragraph 7. Events of Default
For purposes of Section 5(a)(iii)(l) of this Agreement, an Event of Default will exist with respect to a party if:
(i) that party fails (or fails to cause its Custodian (VM)) to make, when due, any Transfer of Eligible Collateral (VM), Posted Collateral (VM) or the Interest Payment (VM), as applicable, required to be made by it and that failure continues for two Local Business Days after notice of that failure is given to that party;
(ii) that party fails to comply with any restriction or prohibition specified in this Annex with respect to any of the rights specified in Paragraph 6(c) and that failure continues for five Local Business Days after notice of that failure is given to that party; or
(iii) that party fails to comply with or perform any agreement or obligation other than those specified in Paragraphs 7(i) and 7(ii) and that failure continues for 30 days after notice of that failure is given to that party.
Paragraph 8. Certain Rights and Remedies
(a) Secured Party 's Rights and Remedies. If at any time (1) an Event of Default or Specified Condition with respect to the Pledgor has occurred and is continuing or (2) an Early Termination Date has occurred or been designated as the result of an Event of Default or Specified Condition with respect to the Pledgor, then, unless the Pledgor has paid in full all of its Obligations that are then due, the Secured Party may exercise one or more of the following rights and remedies:
(i) all rights and remedies available to a secured party under applicable law with respect to Posted Collateral (VM) held by the Secured Party;
(ii) any other rights and remedies available to the Secured Party under the terms of Other Posted Support (VM), if any;
(iii) the right to Set-off (A) any amounts payable by the Pledgor with respect to any Obligations and (B) any Cash amounts and the Cash equivalent of any non-Cash items posted to the Pledgor by the Secured Party as margin under any Other CSA (other than any Other CSA Excluded Credit Support) the return of which is due to the Secured Party against any Posted Collateral (VM) or the Cash equivalent of any Posted Collateral (VM) held by the Secured Party (or any obligation of the Secured Party to Transfer that Posted Collateral (VM)); and
(iv) the right to liquidate any Posted Collateral (VM) held by the Secured Party through one or more public or private sales or other dispositions with such notice, if any, as may be required under applicable law, free from any claim or right of any nature whatsoever of the Pledgor, including any equity or right of redemption by the Pledgor (with the Secured Party having the right to purchase any or all of the Posted Collateral (VM) to be sold) and to apply the proceeds (or the Cash equivalent thereof) from the liquidation of the Posted Collateral (VM) to (A) any amounts payable by the Pledgor with respect to any Obligations and (B) any Cash amounts and the Cash equivalent of any non-Cash items posted to the Pledgor by the Secured Party as margin under any Other CSA (other than any Other CSA Excluded Credit Support) the return of which is due to the Secured Party in that order as the Secured Party may elect.
6 	    	 ISDA®2016
Each party acknowledges and agrees that Posted Collateral (VM) in the form of securities may decline speedily in value and is of a type customarily sold on a recognized market, and, accordingly, the Pledgor is not entitled to prior notice of any sale of that Posted Collateral (VM) by the Secured Party, except any notice that is required under applicable law and cannot be waived.
(b) Pledgor 's Rights and Remedies. If at any time an Early Termination Date has occurred or been designated as the result of an Event of Default or Specified Condition with respect to the Secured Party, then (except in the case of an Early Termination Date relating to fewer than all Transactions where the Secured Party has paid in full all of its obligations that are then due under Section 6(e) of this Agreement):
(i) the Pledgor may exercise all rights and remedies available to a pledgor under applicable law with respect to Posted Collateral (VM) held by the Secured Party;
(ii) the Pledgor may exercise any other rights and remedies available to the Pledgor under the terms of Other Posted Support (VM), if any;
(iii) the Secured Party will be obligated immediately to Transfer all Posted Collateral (VM) and, if the Secured Party is an Interest Payer (VM), the Interest Payment (VM) to the Pledgor; and
(iv) to the extent that Posted Collateral (VM) or the Interest Payment (VM) is not so Transferred pursuant to (iii) above, the Pledgor may:
(A) Set-off any amounts payable by the Pledgor with respect to any Obligations against any Posted Collateral (VM) or the Cash equivalent of any Posted Collateral (VM) held by the Secured Party (or any obligation of the Secured Party to Transfer that Posted Collateral (VM));
(B) Set-off, net, or apply credit support received under any Other CSA or the proceeds thereof against any Posted Collateral (VM) or the Cash equivalent of any Posted Collateral (VM) held by the Secured Party (or any obligation of the Secured Party to Transfer that Posted Collateral (VM)); and
(C) to the extent that the Pledgor does not Set-off under (iv)(A) or (iv)(B) above, withhold payment of any remaining amounts payable by the Pledgor with respect to any Obligations, up to the Value of any remaining Posted Collateral (VM) held by the Secured Party, until that Posted Collateral (VM) is Transferred to the Pledgor.
(c) Deficiencies and Excess Proceeds. The Secured Party will Transfer to the Pledgor any proceeds and Posted Credit Support (VM) remaining after liquidation, Set-off and/or application under Paragraphs 8(a) and 8(b) after satisfaction in full of all amounts payable by the Pledgor with respect to any Obligations; and the Pledgor in all events will remain liable for any amounts remaining unpaid after any liquidation, Set-off and/or application under Paragraphs 8(a) and 8(b).
(d) Final Returns. When no amounts are or thereafter may become payable by the Pledgor with respect to any Obligations (except for any potential liability under Section 2(d) of this Agreement, any obligation to Transfer any Interest Payment (VM) under this Paragraph 8(d) or any obligation to transfer any interest payment under any Other CSA), (i) the Secured Party will Transfer to the Pledgor all Posted Credit Support (VM), and (ii) the Interest Payer (VM) will Transfer to the Interest Payee (VM) any Interest Payment (VM).
Paragraph 9. Representations
Each party represents to the other party (which representations will be deemed to be repeated as of each date on which it, as the Pledgor, Transfers Eligible Collateral (VM)) that:
(i) it has the power to grant a security interest in and lien on any Eligible Collateral (VM) it Transfers as the Pledgor and has taken all necessary actions to authorize the granting of that security interest and lien;
7 	    	 ISDA®2016
(ii) it is the sole owner of or otherwise has the right to Transfer all Eligible Collateral (VM) it Transfers to the Secured Party hereunder, free and clear of any security interest, lien, encumbrance or other restrictions other than the security interest and lien granted under Paragraph 2;
(iii) upon the Transfer of any Eligible Collateral (VM) to the Secured Party under the terms of this Annex, the Secured Party will have a valid and perfected first priority security interest therein (assuming that any central clearing corporation or any third-party financial intermediary or other entity not within the control of the Pledgor involved in the Transfer of that Eligible Collateral (VM) gives the notices and takes the action required of it under applicable law for perfection of that interest); and
(iv) the performance by it of its obligations under this Annex will not result in the creation of any security interest, lien or other encumbrance on any Posted Collateral (VM) other than the security interest and lien granted under Paragraph 2.
Paragraph 10. Expenses
(a) General. Except as otherwise provided in Paragraphs 10(b) and 10(c), each party will pay its own costs and expenses in connection with performing its obligations under this Annex and neither party will be liable for any costs and expenses incurred by the other party in connection herewith.
(b) Posted Credit Support (VM). The Pledgor will promptly pay when due all taxes, assessments or charges of any nature that are imposed with respect to Posted Credit Support (VM) held by the Secured Party upon becoming aware of the same, regardless of whether any portion of that Posted Credit Support (VM) is subsequently disposed of under Paragraph 6(c), except for those taxes, assessments and charges that result from the exercise of the Secured Party's rights under Paragraph 6(c).
(c) Liquidation/Application of Posted Credit Support (VM). All reasonable costs and expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Secured Party or the Pledgor in connection with the liquidation and/or application of any Posted Credit Support (VM) under Paragraph 8 will be payable, on demand and pursuant to the Expenses Section of this Agreement, by the Defaulting Party or, if there is no Defaulting Party, equally by the parties.
Paragraph 11. Miscellaneous
(a) Default Interest. A Secured Party that fails to make, when due, any Transfer of Posted Collateral (VM) will be obligated to pay the Pledgor (to the extent permitted under applicable law) an amount equal to interest at the Default Rate multiplied by the Value of the items of property that were required to be Transferred, from (and including) the date that Posted Collateral (VM) was required to be Transferred to (but excluding) the date of Transfer of that Posted Collateral (VM). This interest will be calculated on the basis of daily compounding and the actual number of days elapsed. An Interest Payer (VM) that fails to make, when due, any Transfer of an Interest Payment (VM) will be obligated to pay the Interest Payee (VM) (to the extent permitted under applicable law) an amount equal to interest at the Default Rate (and for such purposes, if the Default Rate is less than zero, it will be deemed to be zero) multiplied by that Interest Payment (VM), from (and including) the date that Interest Payment (VM) was required to be Transferred to (but excluding) the date of Transfer of that Interest Payment (VM).

" Independent Amount" means, with respect to a party, the amount specified for that party in Paragraph 13, or if no amount is specified, zero.
(iii) (A) "Independent Amount" shall not apply to Party A for purposes of this Annex.

"Transaction Independent Amount" means, as of any Valuation Date, an amount determined by Party A as follows:

(iii) in respect of each Transaction that is neither an In Scope Transaction nor an IA Transaction (an "Out of Scope Transaction"), an amount equal to the product of the notional principal amount (as determined as set forth below) of such Out of Scope Transaction multiplied by the percentage set forth below opposite the relevant type of Out of Scope Transaction in the following grid:
Transaction Type 	    	 Percentage
(1) Fixed income products (including swaps, swaptions, caps, floors, collars, and forward rate agreements) and total return swaps on Instruments other than high yield and convertible bonds, in each case involving only Developed Market Currencies (as defined below) 	    	   	 5 	 %

(9) Any other trappbnsactions not listed here 	    	   	 As  agreed
In respect of the foregoing, if there is a Notional Amount set forth in the Confirmation evidencing an Out of Scope Transaction, the notional principal amount will be such Notional Amount. If there is no Notional Amount set forth in the Confirmation evidencing an Out of Scope Transaction, Party A shall determine the notional principal amount of such Out of Scope Transaction, subject to the following:
(i) if such Out of Scope Transaction is an FX Transaction or Currency Option Transaction, the Transaction Independent Amount shall be based on the USD amount involved in such Out of Scope Transaction (provided, however, that if there is no USD amount involved in such Out of Scope Transaction, then on the USD equivalent, as determined by Party A, of the amount payable to Party A under such Out of Scope Transaction at such time or thereafter; and provided, further, that, for this purpose, all such Out of Scope Transactions will be treated as Deliverable and the amount payable to Party A in respect of each Currency Option Transaction will be determined on the basis that such Currency Option Transaction will be exercised),
(ii) if such Out of Scope Transaction is an equity Option Transaction, the Transaction Independent Amount shall be based on the product of the Strike Price times the Option Entitlement (if any) times the Number of Options of such Out of Scope Transaction, and
(iii) if such Out of Scope Transaction involves a Commodity (other than an energy Commodity), the Transaction Independent Amount shall be based on an amount equal to the product of the highest Notional Quantity for a Calculation Period (or if there is only one Calculation Period, the Total Notional Quantity) times the Specified Price on the Trade Date of such Out of Scope Transaction (provided, however, that if such Out of Scope Transaction involves an energy Commodity, the Transaction Independent Amount shall be an amount equal to the product of (a) the total notional principal amount of such Out of Scope Transaction (the Total Notional Quantity or other similar quantity definition denominating the entire quantity for the term of
such Out of Scope Transaction) times (b) the fixed price (or contract price or other similar pricing definition for the price of the Commodity subject to such Out of Scope Transaction as of the Trade Date) times (c) 15%).
If any Out of Scope Transaction involves more than one Notional Amount, the higher value will apply for purposes of this calculation. If in any case the relevant amount is not expressed in USD, the USD equivalent thereof, as determined by Party A, shall be applicable for the purposes of determining the Transaction Independent Amount with respect to Out of Scope Transactions.
(Terms used in subsections (i), (ii), and (iii) immediately above without definition herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Confirmation of the relevant Out of Scope Transaction.)
"Currency Stress Amount" means, as of the relevant Valuation Date, an amount determined by Party A representing the greatest potential loss to Party B in respect of in Scope Transactions resulting from the application of one or more risk scenarios formulated by Party A that Party A determines to be appropriate as of such Valuation Date, which scenarios are based on, among other things, changes to the valuations of certain currencies or groups of currencies.

a) 	  Where you provide financial instruments to us under a title transfer collateral arrangement or if we exercise a right of use in relation to any financial instruments that you have provided to us by way of collateral under a security collateral arrangement containing a right of use, we draw your attention to the following Re-use Risks and Consequences:1
i. 	  your rights, including any proprietary rights that you may have had, in those financial instruments will be replaced by an unsecured contractual claim for delivery of equivalent financial instruments subject to the terms of the relevant Collateral Arrangement;
ii. 	  those 'financial instruments will not be held by us in accordance with client asset rules, and, if they had benefited from any client asset protection rights, those protection rights will not apply (for example, the financial instruments will not be segregated from our assets and will not be held subject to a trust);
1  	  As noted above, Appendix 3 sets forth the risks and consequences that may arise in connection with re-use of financial instruments by a U.S. broker-dealer, U.S. futures commission merchant, or U.S. bank or U.S. branch or agency office of a non- U.S. bank.

Neither the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc., the Association for Financial Markets in Europe, the Futures Industry Association, Inc„ the International Capital Market Association and the International Securities Lending Association nor SIFMA, has reviewed or endorsed any modifications that may have been made to this document.
iii. 	  in the event of our insolvency or default under the relevant agreement your claim against us for delivery of equivalent financial instruments will not be secured and will be subject to the terms of the relevant Collateral Arrangement and applicable law and, accordingly, you may not receive such equivalent financial instruments or recover the full value of the financial instruments (although your exposure may be reduced to the extent that you have liabilities to us which can be set off or netted against or discharged by reference to our obligation to deliver equivalent financial instruments to you);
iv. 	  in the event that a resolution authority exercises its powers under any relevant resolution regime in relation to us any rights you may have to take any action against us, such as to terminate our agreement, may be subject to a stay by the relevant resolution authority and:
a) 	  your claim for delivery of equivalent financial instruments may be reduced (in part or in full) or converted into equity; or
b) 	  a transfer of assets or liabilities may result in your claim on us, or our claim on you, being transferred to different entities
although you may be protected to the extent that the exercise of resolution powers is restricted by the availability of set-off or netting rights;
v. 	  as a result of your ceasing to have a proprietary interest in those financial instruments you will not be entitled to exercise any voting, consent or similar rights attached to the financial instruments, and even if we have agreed to exercise voting, consent or similar rights attached to any equivalent financial instruments in accordance with your instructions or the relevant Collateral Arrangement entitles you to notify us that the equivalent financial instruments to be delivered by us to you should reflect your instructions with respect to the subject matter of such vote, consent or exercise of rights, in the event that we do not hold and are not able to readily obtain equivalent financial instruments, we may not be able to comply (subject to any other solution that may have been agreed between the parties);
vi. 	  in the event that we are not able to readily obtain equivalent financial instruments to deliver to you at the time required: you may be unable to fulfil your settlement obligations under a hedging or other transaction you have entered into in relation to those financial instruments; a counterparty, exchange or other person may exercise a right to buy-in the relevant financial instruments; and you may be unable to exercise rights or take other action in relation to those financial instruments;

vii. 	  subject to any express agreement between you and us, we will have no obligation to inform you of any corporate events or actions in relation to those financial instruments;
viii. 	  you will not be entitled to receive any dividends, coupon or other payments, interests or rights (including securities or property accruing or offered at any time) payable in relation to those financial instruments, although the express written terms of the relevant Collateral Arrangement or Transaction may provide for you to receive or be credited with a payment by reference to such dividend, coupon or other payment (a "manufactured payment");
ix. 	  the provision of title transfer collateral to us, our exercise of a right of use in respect of any financial collateral provided to us by you and the delivery by us to you of equivalent financial instruments may give rise to tax consequences that differ from the tax consequences that would have otherwise applied in relation to the holding by you or by us for your account of those financial instruments;
x. 	  where you receive or are credited with a manufactured payment, your tax treatment may differ from your tax treatment in respect of the original dividend, coupon or other payment in relation to those financial instruments.

i. 	  if we are declared to be in default by an EU central counterparty ( "EU CCP") the EU CCP will try to transfer ( "port") your transactions and assets to another clearing broker or, if this cannot be achieved, the EU CCP will terminate your transactions;
ii. 	  in the event that other parties in the clearing structure default (e.g., a central counterparty, a custodian, settlement agent or any clearing broker that we may instruct) you may not receive all of your assets back and your rights may differ depending on the law of the country in which the party is incorporated (which may not necessarily be English law) and the specific protections that party has put in place;
iii. 	  in some cases a central counterparty may benefit from legislation which protects actions it may take under its default rules in relation to a defaulting clearing member (e.g., to port transactions and related assets) from being challenged under relevant insolvency law.

Appendix 3
U.S. BROKER-DEALER, U.S. FUTURES COMMISSION MERCHANT, or U.S. BANK:
This Appendix describes the Re-use Risks and Consequences that may arise under Collateral Arrangements with a bank chartered under U.S. federal or state law, a U.S. branch or agency office of a non-U.S. bank (any such bank, branch, or agency office, a " U.S. banking organization"), a U.S. entity that is registered as a broker-dealer with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("broker-dealer"), or a U.S. entity that is registered as a futures commission merchant with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("FCM"). A single U.S.
entity can operate, and be regulated, as both a broker-dealer and an FCM, but it remains subject to separate regulatory requirements with respect to its separate activities.
U.S. law draws a distinction between financial instruments delivered to a broker-dealer or FCM and treated as customer assets ( "Customer Assets"), financial instruments held by a U.S. banking organization in a trust or custodial capacity ( "Custodial Assets"), and financial instruments delivered or pledged to a U.S. banking organization, broker-dealer, or FCM in a principal (non-customer) capacity ( "Non-Customer Assets"). Customer Assets held by a broker-dealer or FCM are subject to mandatory segregation requirements under the rules of the SEC and CFTC, respectively, and special- purpose insolvency regimes under which segregated assets, i.e., Customer Assets and cash required to be held in segregated accounts, are distributed to customers. Custodial Assets held by a U.S. banking organization are generally segregated on an account- or customer-specific basis, while in some circumstances broker-dealers and FCMs are permitted to segregate Customer Assets on an omnibus basis for all customers.
Financial instruments held in a securities account at a broker-dealer or delivered to an FCM as margin (or "performance bond") for a cleared derivative generally constitute Customer Assets. On the other hand, securities delivered to us under a repurchase or securities lending agreement generally do not constitute Customer Assets. If, with respect to Customer Assets received by us as a broker-dealer, you separately agree to lend financial instruments to us under a securities lending agreement, or agree to sell financial instruments to us under a repurchase agreement, then the financial instruments are removed from your account and are no longer eligible for customer protection. Any financial instruments delivered to us under such transactions are Non-Customer Assets. _If you are uncertain whether a financial instrument pledged or delivered to us is a Customer Asset, please obtain legal advice._
With respect to Customer Assets received by us as an FCM in connection with your CFTC-regulated transactions, we generally cannot use such Customer Assets other than to margin, guarantee or secure those transactions. That is, we may transfer such assets to segregated or secured accounts established by us with banks, clearing houses and clearing brokers, which acknowledge, via rules or written agreements, that such Customer Assets are the property of the FCM's customers and can be utilized solely to margin, guarantee or secure customer transactions. In addition, an FCM may, pursuant to repurchase agreements, substitute such segregated Customer Assets, subject to very strict CFTC regulations, including the requirement that such substitution is made on a "delivery versus delivery"

basis, and the market value of the substituted securities is at least equal to that of the Customer Assets being substituted. To the extent segregated assets were found to be insufficient to satisfy customer claims in full, customers would continue to have a claim against the proprietary assets of the FCM.
With respect to Customer Assets received by us as a broker-dealer in connection with your SEC-regulated transactions, we generally can use such Customer Assets only with your consent and subject to regulatory usage limits that are imposed both at the account level (by reference to the amount of your obligations to us) and across all customers (by reference to the amount of all customer obligations to us). The SEC requires that broker-dealers perform a daily valuation of Customer Assets (including related customer obligations) and maintain in segregation either Customer Assets or cash or other high-grade assets such that the value of segregated assets will at all times exceed the value of all Customer Assets net of customer obligations to the broker-dealer.
Further, to the extent segregated assets were to be insufficient to satisfy customer claims in full, customers would continue to have a claim against the proprietary assets of the broker-dealer.
Notwithstanding point (b) of paragraph 2 of Article 15 of the Securities Financing Transactions Regulation, when we use your Customer Assets, they continue to be included on your account statement reflecting their status as Customer Assets, and we may not identify to you the financial instruments that we have used.
If we are a broker-dealer or FCM, our exercise of our right to use Customer Assets has no effect on the nature of your property interest in the financial instruments or on your rights as a customer in the event of our insolvency.
The amount of your customer claim in a broker-dealer or FCM insolvency proceeding is a function of the value of assets held in your account and the amount of your obligations to us, if any. In a broker-dealer or FCM insolvency proceeding, all customers generally receive the same pro rata share of their claims based on Customer Assets (and customer cash), regardless of whether their financial instruments were subject to use or were used by the broker- dealer or FCM. (In the case of an FCM insolvency, customers are separated into several account classes based on product type, and recoveries may vary across account classes. Customers within the same account class receive the same pro rata share of all customer claims within that class.)
In the insolvency of a U.S. banking organization, Custodial Assets are generally returned to their owners to the extent such assets are available for distribution. Your consent to our use of your financial instruments may prevent them from being treated as Custodial Assets, and it may jeopardize your right to obtain their return in the event of our insolvency.
Collateral Arrangements with respect to Non-Customer Assets can take a variety of forms with differing legal characterizations and practical consequences.
Generally, a title transfer collateral arrangement entitles you only to a creditor claim for the return of your financial instruments. Under a security collateral arrangement, in some cases you may retain a property interest in the financial instruments delivered to us as collateral, but your property right (if any) may be subject to superior rights of our creditors or of a party to which we have transferred the financial instruments. Additionally, in the event of our insolvency, you may lose your property interest if you are unable to identify your property as distinct from our other assets, and our use of your financial instruments may impair your ability to do so.
This Appendix is not intended to provide a complete description of the treatment of Collateral Arrangements under U.S. law or the U.S. customer protection system, and you should not rely on it for that purpose.

If we are a U.S. broker-dealer, U.S. FCM, or U.S. banking organization, Sections 2(a)(i) through (v) of the Information Statement do not apply.
Instead, where you provide financial instruments to us under a title transfer collateral arrangement or if we exercise a right of use in relation to any financial instruments that you have provided to us by way of collateral under a security collateral arrangement containing a right of use, we draw your attention to the following Re-use Risks and Consequences:
Paragraph 2._Risks in Connection with Financial Instruments That Are Customer Assets_
If we are a U.S. broker-dealer or FCM and your financial instruments are Customer Assets, then we are permitted to use your financial instruments (i) to post as margin in respect of CFTC-regulated products with a clearing organization or other intermediary, and (ii) as otherwise permitted within the limits imposed by U.S. customer protection rules. When we use your Customer Assets, we may not hold them in segregation or trust, depending on the applicable U.S. regulation, but we continue to report them on your account statement reflecting their status as Customer Assets. As a result of our use of your Customer Assets, those assets are subject to the Re-use Risks and Consequences listed in Sections 2(a)(vi) through (x) of the Information Statement. In addition, if we provide you with clearing services (whether directly as a clearing member or otherwise), Customer Assets are subject to the Re-use Risks and Consequences listed in Section 2(b) of the Information Statement.
Moreover, as a result of our use of those financial instruments (including, in some cases, your ceasing to have a proprietary interest in those financial instruments), or the failure of a third party to deliver to us financial instruments, you may not be entitled to exercise any voting, consent or similar rights attached to the financial instruments, and even if we have agreed to exercise voting, consent or similar rights attached to any equivalent financial instruments in accordance with your instructions or the relevant Collateral Arrangement entitles you to notify us that the equivalent financial instruments to be delivered by us to you should reflect your instructions with respect to the subject matter of such vote, consent or exercise of rights, in the event that we do not hold and are not able to readily obtain equivalent financial instruments, we may not be able to comply (subject to any other solution that may have been agreed between the parties).
However, our right to use Customer Assets and our actual use of Customer Assets do not present any insolvency-related Re-use Risks and Consequences.
This is because, as described above, in the event of our insolvency your claim for Customer Assets would be calculated according to a formula that does not take our use of assets into account.
In the event that a receiver, conservator or other insolvency official exercises its powers under an insolvency regime in relation to us, any rights you may have to take any action against us, such as to terminate our agreement, may be subject to a stay by the relevant authority and a transfer of assets or liabilities may result in your claim on us, or our claim on you, being transferred to different entities. However, this risk exists regardless of whether we have used your financial instruments or you have consented to their use.
Paragraph 3._Risks in Connection with Financial Instruments That Are Non-Customer Assets_
Non-Customer Assets are not protected by the U.S. customer protection rules that apply to Customer Assets. If we are a U.S. broker-dealer or FCM and your financial instruments are Non-Customer Assets, or we are a U.S. banking organization, and you have granted us a right to use your financial instruments, then we will not hold such financial instruments in segregation or trust. Your rights, including any

proprietary rights that you may have had, in those financial instruments may be replaced by a contractual claim (which would be unsecured unless otherwise agreed) for the delivery of equivalent financial instruments subject to the terms of the relevant Collateral Arrangement. As a result of our use of your Non-Customer Assets, those assets are subject to the Re-use Risks and Consequences listed in Sections 2(a)(vi) through (x) of the Information Statement.
If we are a U.S. banking organization, as a result of your consent to our use of your financial instruments, those financial instruments may not be held by us in accordance with the rules that apply to Custodial Assets, and, if they had benefited from any protections as Custodial Assets, those protection rights may not apply (for example, the financial instruments will not be segregated from our assets and will not be held subject to a trust).
Moreover, as a result of our use of financial instruments (including, in some cases, your ceasing to have a proprietary interest in those financial instruments), or the failure of a third party to deliver to us financial instruments, you may not be entitled to exercise any voting, consent or similar rights attached to the financial instruments, and even if we have agreed to exercise voting, consent or similar rights attached to any equivalent financial instruments in accordance with your instructions or the relevant Collateral Arrangement entitles you to notify us that the equivalent financial instruments to be delivered by us to you should reflect your instructions with respect to the subject matter of such vote, consent or exercise of rights, in the event that we do not hold and are not able to readily obtain equivalent financial instruments, we may not be able to comply (subject to any other solution that may have been agreed between the parties).
In the event of our insolvency your rights in financial instruments that we have used may be replaced by a general claim (which would be unsecured unless otherwise agreed) against us for equivalent financial instruments or the value of those financial instruments, and you may not receive such equivalent financial instruments or recover the full value of the financial instruments (although your exposure may be reduced to the extent that we have provided collateral to you or you have liabilities to us which can be set off or netted against or discharged by reference to our obligation to deliver equivalent financial instruments to you). To the extent you retain a property interest in financial assets we have used, our use of the financial instruments may give other parties superior rights in them and may interfere with your ability to identify the financial instruments for the purpose of obtaining their return.
In the event that a receiver, conservator or other insolvency official exercises its 'powers under an insolvency regime in relation to us, any rights you may have to take any action against us, such as to terminate our agreement, may be subject to a stay by the relevant authority and a transfer of assets or liabilities may result in your claim on us, or our claim on you, being transferred to different entities. However, this risk exists regardless of whether we have used your financial instruments or you have consented to their use.
