The Confirmation shall describe the Purchased Securities (including CUSIP or CINS or other identifying number or numbers, if any), identify Buyer and Seller and set forth-
(i) 	   	 the Purchase Date;
(ii) 	   	 the Purchase Price;

(viii) 	   	 any additional terms or conditions of the Transaction;

The Confirmation relating to a Transaction shall, together with this Agreement, constitute prima facie evidence of the terms agreed between Buyer and Seller for that Transaction, unless objection is made with respect to the Confirmation promptly after receipt thereof. In the event of any conflict between the terms of such Confirmation and this Agreement, the Confirmation shall prevail in respect of that Transaction and those terms only.
(c) 	   	 On the Purchase Date for a Transaction, Seller shall transfer the Purchased Securities to Buyer or its agent against the payment of the Purchase Price by Buyer.
(d) 	   	 Termination of a Transaction will be effected, in the case of on demand Transactions, on the date specified for Termination in such demand, and, in the case of fixed term Transactions, on the date fixed for Termination.
(e) 	   	 In the case of on demand Transactions, demand for Termination shall be made by Buyer or Seller, by telephone or otherwise, and shall provide for Termination to occur after not less than the minimum period as is customarily required for the settlement or delivery of money or Equivalent Securities of the relevant kind.
(f) 	   	 On the Repurchase Date, Buyer shall transfer to Seller or its agent Equivalent Securities against the payment of the Repurchase Price by Seller (less any amount then payable and unpaid by Buyer to Seller pursuant to paragraph 5).
4. 	   	 MARGIN MAINTENANCE
(a) 	   	 If at any time either party has a Net Exposure in respect of the other party it may by notice to the other party require the other party to make a Margin Transfer to it of an aggregate amount or value at least equal to that Net Exposure.
(b) 	   	 A notice under sub-paragraph (a) above may be given orally or in writing.
(c) 	   	 For the purposes of this Agreement a party has a Net Exposure in respect of the other party if the aggregate of all the first party's Transaction Exposures plus any amount payable to the first party under paragraph 5 but unpaid less the amount of any Net Margin provided to the first party exceeds the aggregate of all the other
#####
party's Transaction Exposures plus any amount payable to the other party under paragraph 5 but unpaid less the amount of any Net Margin provided to the other party; and the amount of the Net Exposure is the amount of the excess. For this purpose any amounts not denominated in the Base Currency shall be converted into the Base Currency at the Spot Rate prevailing at the relevant time.
(d) 	   	 To the extent that a party calling for a Margin Transfer has previously paid Cash Margin which has not been repaid or delivered Margin Securities in respect of which Equivalent Margin Securities have not been delivered to it, that party shall be entitled to require that such Margin Transfer be satisfied first by the repayment of such Cash Margin or the delivery of Equivalent Margin Securities but, subject to this, the composition of a Margin Transfer shall be at the option of the party making such Margin Transfer.
(e) 	   	 Any Cash Margin transferred shall be in the Base Currency or such other currency as the parties may agree.
(f) 	   	 A payment of Cash Margin shall give rise to a debt owing from the party receiving such payment to the party making such payment. Such debt shall bear interest at such rate, payable at such times, as may be specified in Annex I in respect of the relevant currency or otherwise agreed between the parties, and shall be repayable subject to the terms of this Agreement.
(g) 	   	 Where Seller or Buyer becomes obliged under sub-paragraph (a) above to make a Margin Transfer, it shall transfer Cash Margin or Margin Securities or Equivalent Margin Securities within the minimum period specified in Annex I or, if no period is there specified, such minimum period as is customarily required for the settlement or delivery of money, Margin Securities or Equivalent Margin Securities of the relevant kind.
(h) 	   	 The parties may agree that, with respect to any Transaction, the provisions of sub-paragraphs (a) to (g) above shall not apply but instead that margin may be provided separately in respect of that Transaction in which case -
(i) 	   	 that Transaction shall not be taken into account when calculating whether either party has a Net Exposure;
(ii) 	   	 margin shall be provided in respect of that Transaction in such manner as the parties may agree; and
(iii) 	   	 margin provided in respect of that Transaction shall not be taken into account for the purposes of sub-paragraphs (a) to (g) above.
(i) 	   	 The parties may agree that any Net Exposure which may arise shall be eliminated not by Margin Transfers under the preceding provisions of this paragraph but by the repricing of Transactions under sub-paragraph (j) below, the adjustment of Transactions under sub-paragraph (k) below or a combination of both these methods.
(j) 	   	 Where the parties agree that a Transaction is to be repriced under this sub-paragraph, such repricing shall be effected as follows -
(i) 	   	 the Repurchase Date under the relevant Transaction (the "Original Transaction") shall be deemed to occur on the date on which the repricing is to be effected (the "Repricing Date");
(ii) 	   	 the parties shall be deemed to have entered into a new Transaction (the "Repriced Transaction") on the terms set out in (iii) to (vi) below;
(iii) 	   	 the Purchased Securities under the Repriced Transaction shall be Securities equivalent to the Purchased Securities under the Original Transaction;
(iv) 	   	 the Purchase Date under the Repriced Transaction shall be the Repricing Date;
(v) 	   	 the Purchase Price under the Repriced Transaction shall be such amount as shall, when multiplied by the Margin Ratio applicable to the Original Transaction, be equal to the Market Value of such Securities on the Repricing Date;
(vi) 	   	 the Repurchase Date, the Pricing Rate, the Margin Ratio and, subject as aforesaid, the other terms of the Repriced Transaction shall be identical to those of the Original Transaction;
(vii) 	   	 the obligations of the parties with respect to the delivery of the Purchased Securities and the payment of the Purchase Price under the Repriced Transaction shall be set off against their obligations with respect
#####
to the delivery of Equivalent Securities and payment of the Repurchase Price under the Original Transaction and accordingly only a net cash sum shall be paid by one party to the other. Such net cash sum shall be paid within the period specified in sub-paragraph (g) above.
(k) 	   	 The adjustment of a Transaction (the "Original Transaction") under this sub-paragraph shall be effected by the parties agreeing that on the date on which the adjustment is to be made (the "Adjustment Date") the Original Transaction shall be terminated and they shall enter into a new Transaction (the "Replacement Transaction") in accordance with the following provisions-
(i) 	   	 the Original Transaction shall be terminated on the Adjustment Date on such terms as the parties shall agree on or before the Adjustment Date;
(ii) 	   	 the Purchased Securities under the Replacement Transaction shall be such Securities as the parties shall agree on or before the Adjustment Date (being Securities the aggregate Market Value of which at the Adjustment Date is substantially equal to the Repurchase Price under the Original Transaction at the Adjustment Date multiplied by the Margin Ratio applicable to the Original Transaction);
(iii) 	   	 the Purchase Date under the Replacement Transaction shall be the Adjustment Date;
(iv) 	   	 the other terms of the Replacement Transaction shall be such as the parties shall agree on or before the Adjustment Date; and
(v) 	   	 the obligations of the parties with respect to payment and delivery of Securities on the Adjustment Date under the Original Transaction and the Replacement Transaction shall be settled in accordance with paragraph 6 within the minimum period specified in sub-paragraph (g) above.
5. 	   	 INCOME PAYMENTS
Unless otherwise agreed -
(i) 	   	 where the Term of a particular Transaction extends over an Income Payment Date in respect of any Securities subject to that Transaction, Buyer shall on the date such Income is paid by the issuer transfer to or credit to the account of Seller an amount equal to (and in the same currency as) the amount paid by the issuer;
(ii) 	   	 where Margin Securities are transferred from one party ("the first party") to the other party ("the second party") and an Income Payment Date in respect of such Securities occurs before Equivalent Margin Securities are transferred by the second party to the first party, the second party shall on the date such Income is paid by the issuer transfer to or credit to the account of the first party an amount equal to (and in the same currency as) the amount paid by the issuer;
and for the avoidance of doubt references in this paragraph to the amount of any income paid by the issuer of any Securities shall be to an amount paid without any withholding or deduction for or on account of taxes or duties notwithstanding that a payment of such Income made in certain circumstances may be subject to such a withholding or deduction.
6. 	   	 PAYMENT AND TRANSFER
(a) 	   	 Unless otherwise agreed, all money paid hereunder shall be in immediately available, freely convertible funds of the relevant currency. All Securities to be transferred hereunder (i) shall be in suitable form for transfer and shall be accompanied by duly executed instruments of transfer or assignment in blank (where required for transfer) and such other documentation as the transferee may reasonably request, or (ii) shall be transferred through the book entry system of Euroclear or Cedel, or (iii) shall be transferred through any other agreed securities clearance system, or (iv) shall be transferred by any other method mutually acceptable to Seller and Buyer.
(b) 	   	 Unless otherwise agreed, all money payable by one party to the other in respect of any Transaction shall be paid free and clear of, and without withholding or deduction for, any taxes or duties of whatsoever nature imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any authority having power to tax, unless the withholding or
#####
deduction of such taxes or duties is required by law. In that event, unless otherwise agreed, the paying party shall pay such additional amounts as will result in the net amounts receivable by the other party (after taking account of such withholding or deduction)  being equal to such amounts as would have been received by it had no such taxes or duties been required to be withheld or deducted.
(c) 	   	 Unless otherwise agreed in writing between the parties, under each Transaction transfer of Purchased Securities by Seller and payment of Purchase Price by Buyer against the transfer of such Purchased Securities shall be made simultaneously and transfer of Equivalent Securities by Buyer and payment of Repurchase Price payable by Seller against the transfer of such Equivalent Securities shall be made simultaneously.
(d) 	   	 Subject to and without prejudice to the provisions of sub-paragraph 6(c), either party may from time to time in accordance with market practice and in recognition of the practical difficulties in arranging simultaneous delivery of Securities and money waive in relation to any Transaction its rights under this Agreement to receive simultaneous transfer and/or payment provided that transfer and/or payment shall, notwithstanding such waiver, be made on the same day and provided also that no such waiver in respect of one Transaction shall affect or bind it in respect of any other Transaction.
(e) 	   	 The parties shall execute and deliver all necessary documents and take all necessary steps to procure that all right, title and interest in any Purchased Securities, any Equivalent Securities, any Margin Securities and any Equivalent Margin Securities shall pass to the party to which transfer is being made upon transfer of the same in accordance with this Agreement, free from all liens, claims, charges and encumbrances.
(f) 	   	 Notwithstanding the use of expressions such as "Repurchase Date", "Repurchase Price", "margin", "Net Margin", "Margin Ratio" and "substitution" which are used to reflect terminology used in the market for transactions of the kind provided for in this Agreement, all right, title and interest in and to Securities and money transferred or paid under this Agreement shall pass to the transferee upon transfer or payment, the obligation of the party receiving Purchased Securities or Margin Securities being an obligation to transfer Equivalent Securities or Equivalent Margin Securities.
(g) 	   	 Time shall be of the essence in this Agreement.
(h) 	   	 Subject to paragraph 10, all amounts in the same currency payable by each party to the other under any Transaction or otherwise under this Agreement on the same date shall be combined in a single calculation of a net sum payable by one party to the other and the obligation to pay that sum shall be the only obligation of either party in respect of those amounts.
(i) 	   	 Subject to paragraph 10, all Securities of the same issue, denomination, currency and series, transferable by each party to the other under any Transaction or hereunder on the same date shall be combined in a single calculation of a net quantity of Securities transferable by one party to the other and the obligation to transfer the net quantity of Securities shall be the only obligation of either party in respect of the Securities so transferable and receivable.
7. 	   	 CONTRACTUAL CURRENCY
(a) 	   	 All the payments made in respect of the Purchase Price or the Repurchase Price of any Transaction shall be made in the currency of the Purchase Price (the "Contractual Currency") save as provided in paragraph l0(c)(ii). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the payee of any money may, at its option, accept tender thereof in any other currency, provided, however, that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the obligation of the payer to pay such money will be discharged only to the extent of the amount of the Contractual Currency that such payee may, consistent with normal banking procedures, purchase with such other currency (after deduction of any premium and costs of exchange) for delivery within the customary delivery period for spot transactions in respect of the relevant currency.
(b) 	   	 If for any reason the amount in the Contractual Currency received by a party, including amounts received after conversion of any recovery under any judgment or order expressed in a currency other than the Contractual Currency, falls short of the amount in the Contractual Currency due and payable, the party required to make the payment will, as a separate and independent obligation, to the extent permitted by applicable law, immediately transfer such additional amount in the Contractual Currency as may be necessary to compensate for the shortfall.
#####
(c) 	   	 If for any reason the amount in the Contractual Currency received by a party exceeds the amount of the Contractual Currency due and payable, the party receiving the transfer will refund promptly the amount of such excess.
8. 	   	 SUBSTITUTION
(a) 	   	 A Transaction may at any time between the Purchase Date and the Repurchase Date, if Seller so requests and Buyer so agrees, be varied by the transfer by Buyer to Seller of Securities equivalent to the Purchased Securities, or to such of the Purchased Securities as shall be agreed, in exchange for the transfer by Seller to Buyer of other Securities of such amount and description as shall be agreed ("New Purchased Securities") (being Securities having a Market Value at the date of the variation at least equal to the Market Value of the Equivalent Securities transferred to Seller).
(b) 	   	 Any variation under sub-paragraph (a) above shall be effected, subject to paragraph 6(d), by the simultaneous transfer of the Equivalent Securities and New Purchased Securities concerned.
(c) 	   	 A Transaction which is varied under sub-paragraph (a) above shall thereafter continue in effect as though the Purchased Securities under that Transaction consisted of or included the New Purchased Securities instead of the Securities in respect of which Equivalent Securities have been transferred to Seller.

has or will, in the notifying party's reasonable opinion, have a material adverse effect on that party in the context of a Transaction.

(f) 	   	 This paragraph is without prejudice to paragraph 6(b) (obligation to pay additional amounts if withholding or deduction required); but an obligation to pay such additional amounts may, where appropriate, be a circumstance which causes this paragraph to apply.

2. 	   	 Scope

3. 	   	 CGO Service
3.1 	   	 The CGO Service shall be an agreed securities clearance system for the purposes of paragraph 6(a)(iii) of the Agreement.

3.3 	   	 Where any transfer of Securities under or for the purposes of the Agreement or any Transaction results, under the rules and procedures of the CGO Service, in a payment (whether under paragraph 3.2 above or otherwise) which is not required to be made by the Agreement or the terms of the relevant Transaction -
(a) 	   	 where the amount of the relevant payment is less than £100, the payment shall be treated as made by way of margin adjustment under paragraph 4 of the Agreement;
#####
(b) 	   	 in any other case the party receiving such payment shall, unless the parties shall have agreed otherwise, cause an irrevocable payment in the same amount to be made to the other party for value the same day through the CHAPS system or another guaranteed payment system agreed between the parties.

(b) 	   	 The Confirmation relating to a DBV Transaction -
(i) 	   	 shall specify the Transaction as a DBV Transaction;

Such payment shall be made through the CGO Service or outside the CGO Service in same day funds.
(e) 	   	 If on the Repurchase Date of a DBV Transaction Equivalent Securities are not delivered to the Seller by reason of the fact that -

(ii) 	   	 overnight collateral chits issued by the CGO Service at the request of the Buyer have not been returned to the CGO Service on the Repurchase Date by the latest time fixed for such return by the rules and procedures of the CGO Service;
then, unless before the latest time for delivery of such Equivalent Securities under the rules and procedures of the CGO Service an Event of Default has occurred under paragraph 10 of the Agreement in respect of either Party, such non-delivery shall be deemed to constitute -
(A) 	   	 where the Buyer's membership of the CGO Service has been terminated or suspended or sub-paragraph (ii) above applies, a failure by the Buyer to deliver Equivalent Securities on the Repurchase Date;
(B) 	   	 where the Seller's membership of the CGO Service has been terminated or suspended, a failure by the Seller to pay the Repurchase Price on the Repurchase Date.
(f) 	   	 If after an Event of Default has occurred under paragraph 10 of the Agreement Equivalent Securities to the Purchased Securities are delivered to a securities account of the Seller against the creation of an assured payment obligation in accordance with the rules and procedures of the CGO Service notwithstanding the termination of the relevant DBV Transaction, such delivery shall give rise to the following obligations, each of which shall be conditional on the simultaneous performance of the other.
(i) 	   	 an obligation on the Seller to deliver to the Buyer on demand securities equivalent to the securities so delivered; and
(ii) 	   	 an obligation on the Buyer to pay to the Seller on demand a sum equal to the amount of the assured payment obligation so created.

Such a series of DBV Transactions is in this paragraph referred to as -
(i) 	   	 an "Open DBV Repo " if the Repurchase Date of the last Transaction in the series is not specified in the Confirmation but it is instead provided that, if either Party gives to the other notice of not less than a stated period, the DBV Transaction which will be due for Termination on the date specified in the notice will be the last Transaction in the series and the series will be limited accordingly;
(ii) 	   	 a "Term DBV Repo " if the date on which the last Transaction in the series is due for Termination is specified in the Confirmation.
(b) 	   	 Subject to the following provisions of this sub-paragraph, paragraph 3.4 above shall apply in respect of each DBV Transaction forming part of an Open DBV Repo or a Term DBV Repo.
(c) 	   	 It shall not be necessary for any Transaction forming part of an Open DBV Repo or a Term DBV Repo to be evidenced by a separate Confirmation and, subject to sub-paragraph 3.5(d) below, each such Transaction shall be deemed to be entered into on the Repurchase Date of the preceding such Transaction.
(d) 	   	 Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this sub-paragraph, a transaction which would otherwise be deemed to be entered into on any day and would form part of an Open DBV Repo or a Term DBV Repo shall be deemed not to be entered into if before the parties have taken the steps necessary to effect delivery of the Purchased Securities under that Transaction on that day in accordance with the rules and procedures of the CGO Service -
(i) 	   	 an Event of Default has occurred in relation to either party; or
(ii) 	   	 an earlier Transaction forming part of that Open DBV Repo or Term DBV Repo has been terminated under paragraph 10(e) or 10(f) of the Agreement.
(e) 	   	 In any case where sub-paragraph 3.5(d) above applies, no further Transaction forming part of the relevant Open DBV Repo or Term DBV Repo shall arise.
(f) 	   	 Subject to sub-paragraph 3.5(h) below, and save in so far as the Confirmation relating to an Open DBV Repo or Term DBV Repo may otherwise provide, that part (if any) of the Repurchase Price in respect of each Transaction in the relevant series (other than the last such Transaction) which exceeds the Purchase Price shall not be payable on the Repurchase Date, but shall instead be deferred until, and shall be payable on, the Repurchase Date of the last Transaction in the series. Such payment shall be made through the CGO Service or outside the CGO Service in same-day funds.
(g) 	   	 Any amount payable in respect of a Transaction forming part of an Open DBV Repo or Term DBV Repo payment of which has been deferred under sub-paragraph (f) above shall, until it is paid or the relevant Transaction is terminated under any provision of paragraph 10 of the Agreement, be treated for the purposes of paragraph 4(c) of the Agreement as if it were an amount payable under paragraph 5 of the Agreement.
(h) 	   	 If any Transaction forming part of an Open DBV Repo or Term DBV Repo is terminated under any provision of paragraph 10 of the Agreement, any amounts payable in respect of any earlier Transactions forming part of that Open DBV Repo or Term DBV Repo payment of which has been deferred under sub-paragraph 3.5(f) above shall become due and payable immediately.
4. 	   	 Transactions in partly-paid securities
4.1 	   	 This paragraph applies where -
(a) 	   	 the Purchased Securities under a Transaction are Securities on which a call or instalment remains to be paid; and
#####
(b) 	   	 the due date for the payment of any such call or instalment occurs before the Termination of the Transaction.
4.2 	   	 The Seller shall pay to the Buyer, for value on or before the due date of the call or instalment, an amount equal to the call or instalment payable on that date in respect of Securities equivalent to the Purchased Securities.
4.3 	   	 No adjustment to the Repurchase Price shall be made in consequence of the call or instalment or of the payment made by the Seller under paragraph 4.2 above.
4.4 	   	 On and from the due date for the payment of the call or instalment the expression "Equivalent Securities" shall with respect to that Transaction be taken to mean Securities of the same issuer, forming part of the same issue and being of an identical type, nominal value, description and amount as the Purchased Securities but after payment of the call or instalment in question.
5. 	   	 Exercise of rights of conversion
5.1 	   	 This paragraph applies where the Purchased Securities under a Transaction are Securities in respect of which a right of conversion (whether arising under the terms of issue of the Securities or under a conversion offer made after such issue) becomes exercisable before the Termination of the Transaction.

5.3 	   	 With effect from the latest time for the exercise of the right of conversion the expression "Equivalent Securities" shall be taken to mean -
(a) 	   	 if a notice has been given under paragraph 5.2 above not later than the time specified in that sub-paragraph, such amount of such Securities of such description as fall to be held by a holder of Securities of the same issuer, forming part of the same issue and being of an identical type, nominal value, description and amount as the Purchased Securities if he has exercised the right of conversion in the manner specified in the notice;
(b) 	   	 in any other case, such amount of Securities of such description as fall to be held by a holder of Securities of the same issuer, forming part of the same issue and being of an identical type, nominal value, description and amount as the Purchased Securities if he has not exercised the right of conversion.
6. 	   	 Termination of on demand Transactions
6.1 	   	 Paragraph 3(e) of the Agreement shall not apply, but shall be replaced by the following -
(e) 	   	 "In the case of on demand Transactions, demand for Termination shall be made by Buyer or Seller, by telephone or otherwise, and shall provide for Termination to occur as soon as reasonably practicable after such demand or on such date (being at least one Business Day after that on which the demand is made) as may be specified in the demand; provided that, unless otherwise agreed between the Parties, a demand which is made before 10 a.m. on a Business Day may provide for Termination to occur not later than the close of business on that day."
7. 	   	 Dividend entitlements: effect on margin provisions
7.1 	   	 This paragraph applies where -
(a) 	   	 the ex-dividend date for the payment of any dividend on any Purchased Securities occurs before the Termination of the relevant Transaction; or
#####

1\. Subject to the following provisions of this Annex, either party may enter into Transactions as agent for a third person (a "Principal"), whether as custodian or investment manager or otherwise (a Transaction so entered into being an " Agency Transaction").

(b) of any breach of any of the warranties given in paragraph 8 below or of any event or circumstance which has the result that any such warranty would be untrue if repeated by reference to the current facts; it will inform the other party of that fact and will, if so required by the other party, furnish the other party with such additional information as the other party may reasonably request.

If the other party gives such a notice then an Event of Default shall be treated as occurring in relation to the Principal at the time when the notice is deemed to be given in accordance with paragraph 14 of the Agreement; (ii) if the Principal is neither incorporated nor has established a place of business in Great Britain, the Principal shall for the purposes of paragraph 17 of the Agreement as so applicable be deemed to have appointed as its agent to receive on its behalf service of process in the Courts of England the Agent, or if the Agent is neither incorporated nor has established a place of business in the United Kingdom, the person appointed by the Agent under paragraph 17 of the Agreement, or such other person as the Principal may from time to time specify in a written notice given to the other party.

(i) 	   	 if the affected party has at any time in the period beginning on the date on which the failure occurred and ending at the Default Valuation Time, purchased, whether by way of a repurchase transaction, buy and sell back transaction or otherwise, Securities forming part of the same issue and being of an identical type and description as those Purchased Securities or Equivalent Securities and in substantially the same amount as those Securities, the affected party shall, to the extent that it does not fall within paragraph 2(j), treat the cost of such purchase (including all reasonable costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith) as the Default Market Value of those Securities;
(ii) 	   	 in calculating the Default Market Value, reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with a purchase of Securities under paragraph 2(j)(ii)(aa) or (bb) shall include:

If such net sum is payable by Seller to Buyer, that sum shall be payable on the Repurchase Date under the Replacement Transaction.
(d) 	   	 If on the Repurchase Date for any Transaction Buyer delivers to Seller part only of the Equivalent Securities which it should have delivered (the Delivered Securities and the part of the Equivalent Securities which Buyer has failed to deliver being the Undelivered Securities) Seller shall not be obliged to accept delivery of the Delivered Securities but instead may elect to terminate that Transaction in accordance with paragraph 10(f)(iii) of the Agreement, in which case sub-paragraph (a) above shall apply.

If such net sum is payable by Seller to Buyer, that sum shall be payable on the Repurchase Date under the Replacement Transaction.

To the extent that the withholding tax referred to above is applicable to Buyer and Seller is required to pay the amount of such withholding tax to the Italian tax authorities, Seller shall be entitled to deduct the amount of such tax from the Repurchase Price or, within ten days of the demand of Seller to make the relevant payment, Buyer shall reimburse Seller in respect of the amount required to be paid by it. Seller shall, upon demand by Buyer, provide Buyer with appropriate evidence of the amount of tax deducted and paid to he Italian tax authorities as Buyer may reasonably require to obtain any tax relief under any applicable tax treaty or to obtain any tax credit in respect of its income in the country in which it is resident or out of which it is acting.

#####
(b) 	   	 paragraph 5 of the Agreement shall be modified, in its application to any payment of Income in respect of Italian Bonds other than such a payment falling within sub-paragraph (a) above, by deducting from the amount required to be transferred or credited under that paragraph an amount equal to any amount which would, on the assumption that Buyer owned the Italian Bonds at the relevant Income Payment Date, be withheld or deducted at source on account of Italian tax;
(c) 	   	 in relation to Buy/Sell Back Transactions in Italian Bonds, the amount "IR" in the formula for computing the Sell Back Price pursuant to paragraph 4(iii)(y) of Annex III of the Agreement shall be calculated on the same basis as the amount required to be transferred or credited pursuant to paragraph 5 is calculated in accordance with sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) above;
(d) 	   	 without prejudice to the provisions set out in the final sentence of paragraph 6 above in this Annex IX, neither party shall be obliged to deliver or transfer to the other, or to account to the other for, any tax credits or refunds to which it may become entitled in respect of Income on Italian Bonds; and
