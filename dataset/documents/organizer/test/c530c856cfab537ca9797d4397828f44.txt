2002 MASTER AGREEMENT
dated as of September 26, 2012
JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.	 and	 WELLS CORE OFFICE INCOME OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, L.P.
have entered and/or anticipate entering into one or more transactions (each a "Transaction") that are or will be
governed by this 2002 Master Agreement, which includes the schedule (the "Schedule"), and the documents and
other confirming evidence (each a "Confirmation") exchanged between the parties or otherwise effective for the
purpose of confirming or evidencing those Transactions. This 2002 Master Agreement and the Schedule are together
referred to as this "Master Agreement".
Accordingly, the parties agree as follows:-
1. Interpretation
(a) Definitions. The terms defined in Section 14 and elsewhere in this Master Agreement will have the
meanings therein specified for the purpose of this Master Agreement.
(b) Inconsistency. In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of the Schedule and the other
provisions of this Master Agreement, the Schedule will prevail. In the event of any inconsistency between the
provisions of any Confirmation and this Master Agreement, such Confirmation will prevail for the purpose of the
relevant Transaction.
(c) Single Agreement. All Transactions are entered into in reliance on the fact that this Master Agreement and
all Confirmations form a single agreement between the parties (collectively referred to as this "Agreement"), and the
parties would not otherwise enter into any Transactions.
2. Obligations
(a) General Conditions.
(i) Each party will make each payment or delivery specified in each Confirmation to be made by it,
subject to the other provisions of this Agreement.
(ii) Payments under this Agreement will be made on the due date for value on that date in the place of
the account specified in the relevant Confirmation or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement, in freely
transferable funds and in the manner customary for payments in the required currency. Where settlement is
by delivery (that is, other than by payment), such delivery will be made for receipt on the due date in the
manner customary for the relevant obligation unless otherwise specified in the relevant Confirmation or
elsewhere in this Agreement.

(iii) Each obligation of each party under Section 2(a)(i) is subject to (1) the condition precedent that no
Event of Default or Potential Event of Default with respect to the other party has occurred and is continuing,
(2) the condition precedent that no Early Termination Date in respect of the relevant Transaction has
occurred or been effectively designated and (3) each other condition specified in this Agreement to be a
condition precedent for the purpose of this Section 2(a)(iii).
(b) Change of Account. Either party may change its account for receiving a payment or delivery by giving
notice to the other party at least five Local Business Days prior to the Scheduled Settlement Date for the payment or
delivery to which such change applies unless such other party gives timely notice of a reasonable objection to such
change.
(c) Netting of Payments. If on any date amounts would otherwise be payable:-
(i) in the same currency; and
(ii) in respect of the same Transaction,
by each party to the other, then, on such date, each party's obligation to make payment of any such amount will be
automatically satisfied and discharged and, if the aggregate amount that would otherwise have been payable by one
party exceeds the aggregate amount that would otherwise have been payable by the other party, replaced by an
obligation upon the party by which the larger aggregate amount would have been payable to pay to the other party the
excess of the larger aggregate amount over the smaller aggregate amount.
