(a) to the extent required or permitted by any applicable law, rule or regulation which mandates reporting and/or retention of transaction and similar information or to the extent required by any order or directive regarding reporting and/or retention of transaction and similar information issued by any authority or body or agency in accordance with which the other party is required or accustomed to act ("Reporting Requirements"); or
(b) to and between the other party's head office, branches or affiliates, or any persons or entities who provide services to such other party or its head office, branches or affiliates, in each case, in connection with such Reporting Requirements.
Each party acknowledges that pursuant to global regulatory reform initiatives, regulators require reporting of trade data to increase market transparency and enable regulators to monitor systemic risk to ensure safeguards are implemented globally.
40
Each party further acknowledges that disclosures made pursuant hereto may include, without limitation, the disclosure of trade information including a party's identity (by name, address, corporate affiliation, identifier or otherwise) to any swap or trade data repository or one or more systems or services operated by any trade repository ("TR") and any relevant regulators (including without limitation, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission or other U.S. regulators in the case of trade reporting under applicable U.S.
laws, and the European Securities and Markets Authority and national regulators in the E.U. under the E.U. Regulation No. 648/2012 on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories in the case of trade reporting under applicable E.U. laws) and that such disclosures could result in certain anonymous swap transaction and pricing data becoming available to the public. Each party further acknowledges that, for purposes of complying with regulatory reporting obligations, a party may use a third party service provider to transfer trade information into a TR and that a TR may engage the services of a global trade repository regulated by one or more governmental regulators. Each party also acknowledges that disclosures made pursuant hereto may be made to recipients in a jurisdiction other than that of the disclosing party or a jurisdiction that may not necessarily provide an equivalent or adequate level of protection for personal data as the counterparty's home jurisdiction. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) to the extent that applicable non-disclosure, confidentiality, bank secrecy, data privacy or other law imposes non-disclosure requirements on transaction and similar information required or permitted to be disclosed as contemplated herein but permits a party to waive such requirements by consent, the consent and acknowledgements provided herein shall be a consent by each party for purposes of such law; (ii) any agreement between the parties to maintain confidentiality of information contained in this Agreement or in any non- disclosure, confidentiality or other agreement shall continue to apply to the extent that such agreement is not inconsistent with the disclosure of information in connection with the Reporting Requirements as set out herein; and (iii) nothing herein is intended to limit the scope of any other consent to disclosure separately given by each party to the other party.
(n)	 Incorporation of the terms of the IBOR Fallbacks Protocol.
(a)	 From and including 25 January 2021, the terms of the Attachment to the ISDA 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol published by ISDA on 23 October 2020 (IBOR Fallbacks Protocol) are incorporated into and apply to this Agreement. For the purposes of this Agreement the parties will each be deemed to be an 'Adhering Party' with respect to the IBOR Fallbacks Protocol as between themselves and references in the IBOR Fallbacks Protocol to a 'Protocol Covered Document' will be deemed to include references to this Agreement. If each of the parties subsequently becomes or is an Adhering Party to the IBOR Fallbacks Protocol by delivering an Adherence Letter to ISDA in accordance with the IBOR Fallbacks Protocol, to the extent that there is any inconsistency between this Part 5(n) and the IBOR Fallbacks Protocol, the this Part 5(n) shall prevail.
(b)	 Each party represents to the other party that the application of the terms of the IBOR Fallbacks Protocol and any amendment contemplated by the IBOR Fallbacks Protocol (including the Attachment thereto) will not, in and of itself, adversely affect the enforceability, effectiveness or validity of any obligations owed, whether by it or by any third party, under any Credit Support Document in respect of its obligations under this Transaction.
(c)	 Terms used in this Part 5(n) have the meaning given to those term in the IBOR Fallbacks Protocol unless another meaning is provided.
(o)	 Limited Recourse. Except as otherwise stated in the Agreement or this Schedule, any amounts owed or liabilities incurred by Party B in respect of any Transaction entered into under this Agreement may be satisfied solely from the assets of Party B. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and except as otherwise stated above, in no event shall Party A have recourse under this Agreement, whether by set-off or otherwise, with respect to any such amounts owed or liabilities incurred to or against (i) any assets of any person or entity (including, without limitation, any person or entity whose account is under the management of the General Partner) other than Party B, (ii) any assets of any affiliate of Party B, or (iii) any assets of the General Partner or any affiliate of such General Partner.
41
(p)	 Condition End Date. Section 2 of the Agreement is amended to add at the end a new Section 2(e), reading in its entirety as follows:
"(e)          Condition End Date.
(i)     If an Event of Default occurs, the Defaulting Party may, by notice to the Non-defaulting Party identifying the Event of Default and confirming its occurrence, specify that clause (iii) will apply to that Event of Default.
(ii)     If a Potential Event of Default occurs with respect to a party, that party may, by notice to the other party identifying the Potential Event of Default and confirming its occurrence:
(A)     waive any requirement that notice be given or that any period of time elapse, by virtue of which waiver the Potential Event of Default will become an Event of Default; and
(B)      specify that clause (iii) will apply to that Event of Default.
(iii)    If this clause (iii) applies to an Event of Default, then the condition precedent specified in Section 2(a)(iii)(1) with respect to that Event of Default will cease to be a condition precedent to each obligation of the Non-defaulting Party on the relevant Condition End Date. Any obligation that would have been payable or deliverable by the Non-defaulting Party but for Section 2(a)(iii)(1) will become payable or deliverable on the first Local Business Day falling after the Condition End Date (together with interest payable on demand in accordance with Section 9(h)(i)(3)(A) or compensation and interest payable on demand in accordance with Section 9(h)(i)(4)(A), as the case may be).
(iv)    Subject to clause (v) below, if, after a party has given a notice under clause (i) or (ii) above with respect to an Event of Default or Potential Event of Default, another Event of Default or Potential Event of Default occurs with respect to that party, then, with respect to the earlier Event of Default, no Condition End Date will occur and therefore clause (iii) will not apply. This will not affect the right of that party to give a notice under clause (i) in respect of the subsequent Event of Default or under clause (ii) in respect of the subsequent Potential Event of Default. This clause (iv) is without prejudice to the right of the Defaulting Party to give a new notice to the Non-defaulting Party under clause (i) with respect to the earlier Event of Default.
(v)    If the Defaulting Party has given a notice under clause (i) above in respect of an Event of Default under Section 5(a)(vii), then clause (iv) will not apply."
Section 14 of the Agreement is amended to add in the appropriate alphabetical position a new definition of "Condition End Date", reading in its entirety as follows:
"" Condition End Date" means, with respect to an Event of Default, the day falling 90 days after a notice given by the Defaulting Party under Section 2(e)(i) or Section 2(e)(ii) is effective if the Event of Default is still continuing on that day."
42
