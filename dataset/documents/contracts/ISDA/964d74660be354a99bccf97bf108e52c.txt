(ii) The procedure set forth in this subpart (ii) is applicable to all Transactions except Credit Derivative Transactions (as defined in the 2003 ISDA Credit Derivatives Definitions) (or any successor ISDA publication to such definitions) and Non-Disputable Equity Derivatives Transactions). Unless otherwise agreed in a global master confirmation agreement between the parties, a "Non-Disputable Equity Derivatives Transaction" means any Transaction in respect of which (y) the relevant Confirmation incorporates the 2002 ISDA Equity Derivatives Definitions (or any successor ISDA publication to such definitions) and (z) one or more of the Exchanges is located (A) in any of Bahrain, Czech Republic, Egypt, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco, Oman, Poland, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey or the United Arab Emirates, (B) anywhere in Asia other than Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, New Zealand or Singapore or (C) anywhere in Latin America other than Brazil.
A party (the " Objecting Party") has the right to dispute in good faith and on commercially reasonable grounds a particular Determination made by the Calculation Agent, provided that the Objecting Party notifies the other party and the Calculation Agent (if the other party is not the Calculation Agent) of such dispute promptly (but in no event later than one Reference Day) after the Calculation Agent has provided the Objecting Party and the other party (if the other party is not the Calculation Agent) with notice of such Determination.
In any such instance, the parties shall, within three Reference Days after such notice, jointly select three Independent Dealers (or, if the parties cannot jointly agree on three, each party shall select an Independent Dealer, which two Independent Dealers shall jointly select a third Independent Dealer). Each such Independent Dealer shall be requested by the Calculation Agent to make a Determination as to the disputed matter within three Reference Days after its appointment.
In the event that two or three Independent Dealers provide a Determination as to the disputed matter within three Reference Days after their respective appointments:
(y) 	  if those Determinations are susceptible to the calculation of an arithmetic mean, the arithmetic mean of such Determinations shall be binding on the parties for the disputed matter, absent manifest error; or
(z) 	  if those Determinations are not susceptible to the calculation of an arithmetic mean (e.g., Determinations as to whether or not an event has occurred or terms of a Transaction are to be adjusted), then (A) if a majority of the responding Independent Dealers provided the same Determination, such Determination shall be binding on the parties for the disputed matter, absent manifest error, or (B) if a majority of the Independent Dealers did not provide the same Determination, the responding Independent Dealers will jointly appoint a fourth Independent Dealer (the "Resolver"). The Resolver will select, within two Reference Days after its appointment, from the Determinations originally provided by the responding Independent Dealers,
with the selected Determination being binding on the parties for the disputed matter, absent manifest error.
The costs of any Independent Dealers or Resolver shall be borne by (x) the Objecting Party if the Determination made pursuant to this subpart (ii) substantially comports with the relevant Determination made by the Calculation Agent or if the relevant Determination made by the Calculation Agent otherwise applies, (y) Party B if Party B disputes a Determination made by a Calculation Agent selected by Party B, or (z) Party A, if Party A is the Calculation Agent and the Determination made pursuant to this subpart (ii) does not substantially comport with the relevant Determination made by the Calculation Agent.
The following terms used in this Part 5(6) have the following meanings:
"Determination" means any determination, calculation, or adjustment, as the case may be.
"Independent Dealer" means a leading dealer in the relevant market that is not an Affiliate of either of the parties or any other appointed Independent Dealer.
"Reference Day" means, in respect of any Transaction, a Business Day as defined as set forth in the Confirmation evidencing such Transaction or, absent such definition, a day that is a Banking Day (as defined in the 2006 ISDA Definitions) in New York and in the location of the office of Party A where such Transaction is booked.
(iii) A party's right to dispute a Determination under subpart (ii) immediately above shall (1) cease to be applicable at any time that a Potential Event of Default or Event of Default in respect of such party or an Additional Termination Event in respect of which such party is the sole Affected Party has occurred and is continuing, (2) be inapplicable in respect of any Transaction for which the relevant Confirmation or Master Confirmation sets forth procedures for disputing a Determination by the Calculation Agent, and (3) be inapplicable to any Determination made pursuant to the terms of any Protocol sponsored by ISDA to which the parties adhere. Notwithstanding a party's exercise of its right to dispute a Determination under subpart (ii) immediately above, any undisputed amounts or deliveries in respect of any Transaction shall be made by the relevant party as if no dispute existed.
Part 6
Foreign Exchange  & Currency Option Transactions
(1) 	  Section 2.2(a) of the FX Definitions is hereby amended by substituting the following therefor in its entirety:
(a) Deliverable FX Transaction.
(i) Unless the parties expressly agree in a Confirmation of a Deliverable FX Transaction that this subsection (i) shall be inapplicable to such Deliverable FX Transaction, the obligation of Party A to make a payment in respect of any Deliverable FX Transaction on a Settlement Date is subject to the condition precedent that Party B shall have first satisfied its obligation to make each payment under such Deliverable FX Transaction, subject to any applicable condition precedent and any applicable provisions of Article 5.
(ii) If the parties expressly agree in a Confirmation of a Deliverable FX Transaction that subsection (i) immediately above shall be inapplicable to such Deliverable FX Transaction, each party will pay, on the Settlement Date in respect of such Deliverable FX Transaction, the amount specified as payable by it in the related Confirmation, subject to any applicable condition precedent and any applicable provisions of Article 5.
(2) 	  Section 3.4 of the FX Definitions is amended by adding the following:
(c) Discharge and Termination. Unless otherwise agreed, any Call or any Put written by a party will automatically be terminated and discharged, in whole or in part, as applicable, against a Call or a Put, respectively, written by the other party, such termination and discharge to occur automatically upon the payment in full of the last Premium payable in respect of such Currency Option Transactions; provided that such termination and discharge may only occur in respect of Currency Option Transactions:
(i) each being with respect to the same Put Currency and the same Call Currency;
(ii) each having the same Expiration Date and Expiration Time;
(iii) each being of the same style, i.e. either both being American style Currency Option Transactions or both being European style Currency Option Transactions;
(iv) each having the same Strike Price and other material terms;
(v) neither of which shall have been exercised by delivery of a Notice of Exercise; and
(vi) each having been transacted by the same pair of Offices of the Buyer and Seller.
and, upon the occurrence of such termination and discharge, neither party shall have any further obligation to the other party in respect of the relevant Currency Option Transactions or, as the case may be, parts thereof so terminated and discharged. In the case of a partial termination and discharge (i.e., where the relevant Currency Option Transactions are for different amounts of the Currency Pair), the remaining portion of the Currency Option Transaction which is partially discharged and terminated shall continue to be a Currency Option Transaction for all purposes of this Agreement, including this Section 3.4(c).
(3) 	  Section 3.7(a) of the FX Definitions is hereby amended by substituting the following therefor in its entirety:
(a) 	  Deliverable Currency Option Transaction. In respect of an Exercise Date under a Deliverable Currency Option Transaction, on the Settlement Date, except as otherwise set forth in this Section 3.7(a), Buyer will pay to Seller the Put Currency Amount and Seller will pay to Buyer the Call Currency Amount, subject to the provisions of Section 3.6(c), any other applicable condition precedent and any applicable provisions of Article 5. Unless
the parties expressly agree in a Confirmation of a Deliverable Currency Option Transaction that this sentence shall be inapplicable to such Deliverable Currency Option Transaction, Party A may, by notice to Party B before the Settlement Date of any Deliverable Currency Option Transaction, require that each party pay the USD Equivalent of the amount payable by under such Deliverable Currency Option Transaction.

(2) 	  Master Close-out. Without limiting any provision in any JPM Affiliate Agreement, each JPM Affiliate and Party B agree that the occurrence of any event of default, default, termination event, or similar condition or event (however described) in respect of Party B or a JPM Affiliate
(the entity in respect of which such occurrence takes place being the "Master Close-out Defaulting Party") under a JPM Affiliate Agreement on the basis of which the other party to such JPM Affiliate Agreement has the contractual right to terminate, close-out or liquidate all transactions governed by such JPM Affiliate Agreement or which causes the automatic termination of all such transactions shall entitle the Master Close-out Non-Defaulting Party (as defined below) to terminate all transactions governed by any other JPM Affiliate Agreement (each, an "Other JPM Affiliate Agreement"). "Master Close-out Non-Defaulting Party" means (i) Party B if the Master Close-out Defaulting Party is a JPM Affiliate or (ii) the JPM Affiliate that is the party to such Other JPM Affiliate Agreement if the Master Close-out Defaulting Party is Party B. The amount payable in respect of the termination of transactions governed by any such Other JPM Affiliate Agreement shall be determined in accordance with any applicable provisions thereof and, if there are no such applicable provisions, in the same manner as set forth in Section 6 of this Agreement as if the transactions governed by such other JPM Affiliate Agreement were Transactions governed by this Agreement.
(3) 	  Authorization to Transfer Funds. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other agreement, upon the occurrence and during the continuation of any event of default, default, termination event, or similar condition or event (however described) in respect of Party B under any JPM Affiliate Agreement, Party B authorizes each JPM Affiliate, in its sole discretion and without prior notice to Party B, to transfer or cause to be transferred any funds, securities and/or other property to, between, or among any accounts maintained by Party B with or among any JPM Affiliates.
(4) 	  Assignment. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any JPM Affiliate Agreement, upon the occurrence and during the continuation of any event of default, default, termination event, or similar condition or event (however described) in respect of Party B under any JPM Affiliate Agreement, Party B hereby consents and agrees that the rights and obligations of any JPM Affiliate in respect of any JPM Affiliate Agreement may be assigned to any other JPM Affiliate without the prior written consent of Party B.
(5) 	  Additional JPM Set Off Rights. Any amount payable by a JPM Affiliate to Party B in respect of the termination of all transactions governed by a JPM Affiliate Agreement as the result of the occurrence of any event of default, default, termination event, or similar condition or event (however described) in respect of Party B may, at the option of such JPM Affiliate (and without prior notice to Party B), be reduced by its set-off against any Other Agreement Amount (as hereinafter defined). As used herein, "Other Agreement Amount" shall mean any payment obligation of any description whatsoever (whether arising at such time or in the future or upon the occurrence of a contingency) by Party B to any JPM Affiliate (irrespective of the currency, place of payment or booking office of the obligation or whether the relevant party is legally or beneficially the holder of the obligation) arising under any agreement between Party B and any JPM Affiliate or any instrument or undertaking issued or executed or guaranteed by Party B to, or in favor of, any JPM Affiliate or any bond, note, or other debt instrument issued or guaranteed by Party B and owned or held beneficially by any JPM Affiliate as a result of the purchase thereof by or on behalf of any JPM Affiliate, whether directly from the issuer or in the secondary market; and the Other Agreement Amount will be discharged promptly and in all respects to the extent it is so set-off. The JPM Affiliate effecting any set-off pursuant to this section will give notice to Party B of any such set-off.
For this purpose, the Other Agreement Amount (or the relevant portion of such amounts) may be converted by the JPM Affiliate effecting the set-off into the currency in which the obligation of such JPM Affiliate is denominated at the rate of exchange at which such JPM Affiliate would be able, acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith, to purchase the relevant amount of
such currency. If an obligation is unascertained, a JPM Affiliate may in good faith estimate that obligation and set-off in respect of the estimate, subject to the relevant party accounting to the other when the obligation is ascertained. Nothing in this section shall be effective to create a charge or other security interest. This section shall be without prejudice and in addition to any right of set-off, combination of accounts, lien or other right to which any entity is at any time otherwise entitled (whether by operation of law, contract or otherwise).

3 	   	 1SDA® 2002
either case, if four quotations are not available for a particular Covered Transaction, then fewer than four quotations may be used for that Covered Transaction, and if no quotations are available for a particular Covered Transaction, then the Valuation Agent's original calculations will be used for that Covered Transaction; and
(3) utilizing the procedures specified in Paragraph 13 for calculating the Value, if disputed, of Posted Credit Support (VM).

(a) Care of Posted Collateral (VM). Without limiting the Secured Party's rights under Paragraph 6(c), the Secured Party will exercise reasonable care to assure the safe custody of all Posted Collateral (VM) to the extent required by applicable law, and in any event the Secured Party will be deemed to have exercised reasonable care if it exercises at least the same degree of care as it would exercise with respect to its own property. Except as specified in the preceding sentence, the Secured Party will have no duty with respect to Posted Collateral (VM), including, without limitation, any duty to collect any Distributions, or enforce or preserve any rights pertaining thereto.
(b) Eligibility to Hold Posted Collateral (VM); Custodians (VM).
(i) General. Subject to the satisfaction of any conditions specified in Paragraph 13 for holding Posted Collateral (VM), the Secured Party will be entitled to hold Posted Collateral (VM) or to appoint an agent (a _" Custodian (VM)") _to hold Posted Collateral (VM) for the Secured Party. Upon notice by the Secured Party to the Pledgor of the appointment of a Custodian (VM), the Pledgor's obligations to make any Transfer will be discharged by making the Transfer to that Custodian (VM).

(i) sell, pledge, rehypothecate, assign, invest, use, commingle or otherwise dispose of, or otherwise use in its business any Posted Collateral (VM) it holds, free from any claim or right of any nature whatsoever of the Pledgor, including any equity or right of redemption by the Pledgor; and
4 	   	 1SDA® 2002
(ii) register any Posted Collateral (VM) in the name of the Secured Party, its Custodian (VM) or a nominee for either.
For purposes of the obligation to Transfer Eligible Credit Support (VM) or Posted Credit Support (VM) pursuant to Paragraphs 3 and 5 and any rights or remedies authorized under this Agreement, the Secured Party will be deemed to continue to hold all Posted Collateral (VM) and to receive Distributions made thereon, regardless of whether the Secured Party has exercised any rights with respect to any Posted Collateral (VM) pursuant to (i) or (ii) above.
(d) Distributions, Interest Amount (VM) and Interest Payment (VM).
(i) Distributions. Subject to Paragraph 4(a), if the Secured Party receives or is deemed to receive Distributions on a Local Business Day, it will Transfer to the Pledgor not later than the following Local Business Day any Distributions it receives or is deemed to receive to the extent that a Delivery Amount (VM) would not be created or increased by that Transfer, as calculated by the Valuation Agent (and the date of calculation will be deemed to be a Valuation Date for this purpose).
(ii) Interest Amount (VM) and Interest Payment (VM). Unless otherwise specified in Paragraph 13 and subject to Paragraph 4(a), in lieu of any interest, dividends or other amounts paid or deemed to have been paid with respect to Posted Collateral (VM) in the form of Cash (all of which may be retained by the Secured Party),
(A) if "Interest Transfer" is specified as applicable in Paragraph 13, the Interest Payer (VM) will Transfer to the Interest Payee (VM), at the times specified in Paragraph 13, the relevant Interest Payment (VM); provided that if "Interest Payment Netting" is specified as applicable in Paragraph 13:
(1) if the Interest Payer (VM) is entitled to demand a Delivery Amount (VM) or Return Amount (VM), in respect of the date such Interest Payment (VM) is required to be Transferred:
(a) 	  such Delivery Amount (VM) or Return Amount (VM) will be reduced (but not below zero) by such Interest Payment (VM); provided that, in case of such Return Amount (VM), if the amount of Posted Collateral (VM) which is comprised of Cash in the Base Currency is less than such Interest Payment (VM), such reduction will only be to the extent of the amount of such Cash which is Posted Collateral (VM) (the " Eligible Return Amount (VM)"); and
(b) 	  the Interest Payer (VM) will Transfer to the Interest Payee (VM) the amount of the excess, if any, of such Interest Payment (VM) over such Delivery Amount (VM) or Eligible Return Amount (VM), as applicable; and
(II) if under Paragraph 6(d)(ii)(A)(I)(a) a Delivery Amount (VM) is reduced (the amount of such reduction, the " Delivery Amount Reduction (VM)") or a Return Amount (VM) is reduced (the amount of such reduction, the _" Return Amount Reduction (VM)"), _then for purposes of determining Posted Collateral (VM), the Secured Party (a) will be deemed to have received an amount in Cash in the Base Currency equal to any Delivery Amount Reduction (VM), and such amount will constitute Posted Collateral (VM) in such Cash and will be subject to the security interest granted under Paragraph 2 or (b) will be deemed to have Transferred an amount in Cash in the Base Currency equal to any Return Amount Reduction (VM), as applicable, in each case on the day on which the relevant Interest Payment (VM) was due to be Transferred, as applicable; and

5 	   	 1SDA® 2002
(II) if the Interest Amount (VM) for an Interest Period is a negative number and any Posted Collateral (VM) is in the form of Cash in the Base Currency, the Interest Amount (VM) will constitute a reduction of Posted Collateral (VM) in the form of such Cash in an amount (such amount, the _" Interest Adjustment Reduction Amount (VM)") _equal to the absolute value of the Interest Amount (VM); provided that if the amount of Posted Collateral (VM) which is comprised of such Cash is less than the Interest Adjustment Reduction Amount (VM), such reduction will only be to the extent of the amount of such Cash which is Posted Collateral (VM) and the Pledgor will be obligated to Transfer the remainder of the Interest Adjustment Reduction Amount (VM) to the Secured Party on the day that such reduction occurred.

If a party's obligation to make a transfer of credit support under this Annex or an Other CSA is automatically satisfied and discharged pursuant to this Paragraph 11(j), then, for purposes of this Annex or the Other CSA, as applicable, the other party will be deemed to have received credit support of the applicable Fungible Credit Support Type in the amount that would otherwise have been required to be transferred, in each case on the day on which the relevant transfer was due.

" Independent Amount" means, with respect to a party, the amount specified for that party in Paragraph 13, or if no amount is specified, zero.
(iii) 	  (A) "Independent Amount" shall not apply to Party A for purposes of this Annex.

(iii) in respect of each Transaction that is neither an In Scope Transaction nor an IA Transaction (an "Out of Scope Transaction"), an amount equal to the product of the notional principal amount (as determined as set forth below) of such Out of Scope Transaction multiplied by the percentage set forth below opposite the relevant type of Out of Scope Transaction in the following grid:
Transaction Type 	    	 Percentage
(1) Fixed income products (including swaps, swaptions, caps, floors, collars, and forward rate agreements) and total return swaps on Instruments other than high yield and convertible bonds, in each case involving only Developed Market Currencies (as defined below) 	    	   	 5 	 %

(9) Any other transactions not listed here 	    	   	 As  agreed
In respect of the foregoing, if there is a Notional Amount set forth in the Confirmation evidencing an Out of Scope Transaction, the notional principal amount will be such Notional Amount. If there is no Notional Amount set forth in the Confirmation evidencing an Out of Scope Transaction, Party A shall determine the notional principal amount of such Out of Scope Transaction, subject to the following:
(i) if such Out of Scope Transaction is an FX Transaction or Currency Option Transaction, the Transaction Independent Amount shall be based on the USD amount involved in such Out of Scope Transaction (provided, however, that if there is no USD amount involved in such Out of Scope Transaction, then on the USD equivalent, as determined by Party A, of the amount payable to Party A under such Out of Scope Transaction at such time or thereafter; and provided, further, that, for this purpose, all such Out of Scope Transactions will be treated as Deliverable and the amount payable to Party A in respect of each Currency Option Transaction will be determined on the basis that such Currency Option Transaction will be exercised),
(ii) if such Out of Scope Transaction is an equity Option Transaction, the Transaction Independent Amount shall be based on the product of the Strike Price times the Option Entitlement (if any) times the Number of Options of such Out of Scope Transaction, and
(iii) if such Out of Scope Transaction involves a Commodity (other than an energy Commodity), the Transaction Independent Amount shall be based on an amount equal to the product of the highest Notional Quantity for a Calculation Period (or if there is only one Calculation Period, the Total Notional Quantity) times the Specified Price on the Trade Date of such Out of Scope Transaction (provided, however, that if such Out of Scope Transaction involves an energy Commodity, the Transaction Independent Amount shall be an amount equal to the product of (a) the total notional principal amount of such Out of Scope Transaction (the Total Notional Quantity or other similar quantity definition denominating the entire quantity for the term of
such Out of Scope Transaction) times (b) the fixed price (or contract price or other similar pricing definition for the price of the Commodity subject to such Out of Scope Transaction as of the Trade Date) times (c) 15%).
If any Out of Scope Transaction involves more than one Notional Amount, the higher value will apply for purposes of this calculation. If in any case the relevant amount is not expressed in USD, the USD equivalent thereof, as determined by Party A, shall be applicable for the purposes of determining the Transaction Independent Amount with respect to Out of Scope Transactions.
(Terms used in subsections (i), (ii), and (iii) immediately above without definition herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Confirmation of the relevant Out of Scope Transaction.)
"Currency Stress Amount" means, as of the relevant Valuation Date, an amount determined by Party A representing the greatest potential loss to Party B in respect of in Scope Transactions resulting from the application of one or more risk scenarios formulated by Party A that Party A determines to be appropriate as of such Valuation Date, which scenarios are based on, among other things, changes to the valuations of certain currencies or groups of currencies.
