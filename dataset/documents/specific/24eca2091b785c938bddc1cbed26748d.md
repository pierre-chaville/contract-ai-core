(i) Section 6(b)(ii) is hereby deleted and the following shall be inserted in

Counterparty is the Affected Party it will, and if the Trust is the Affected
Party it may request the Counterparty to (and the Counterparty upon notice
thereof will), use its best efforts (provided that using its best efforts will
not require the Counterparty to incur any loss, excluding immaterial,
incidental expenses) to transfer prior to the 20th day following the
occurrence of such event (the **" Transfer Cut-Off Date"**), all of its rights
and obligations under this Agreement in respect of Affected Transactions to
another of its offices or affiliates or third party so that such Termination
Event ceases to exist.

If the Counterparty is not able to make such a transfer it will give notice to
the Trust to that effect prior to the Transfer Cut-Off Date.

Any such transfer under this Section 6(b)(ii) will be subject to and
conditional upon the prior written consent of the Trust, which consent will
not be withheld if the Trust's policies in effect at such time would permit it
to enter into transactions with the transferee on the terms proposed.

(2) No transfer or substitution pursuant to this Section 6(b)(ii) shall occur
(x) unless the Rating Agency Condition is satisfied and (y) if the position of

Trust to verify such matters prior to the occurrence of such transfer or
substitution)."

deleted and the following shall be inserted in its place:

_" Early Termination._

If a Termination Event (excluding Additional Termination Events, in which
case, Section 6(b)(iv) shall apply without modification) has occurred and a
transfer under Section 6(b)(ii) or an agreement under Section 6(b)(iii), as
the case may be, has not been effected with respect to all Affected
Transactions by the Transfer Cut-Off Date, an Early Termination Date in
respect of all outstanding Swap Transactions will occur on the fifth
succeeding Business Day immediately following such Transfer Cut-Off Date,
unless otherwise agreed in writing executed by both parties hereto."

(h) _Payments on Early Termination_.

(i) "Market Quotation" and "Second Method" will apply for purposes of Section
6(e); _provided, however_ , that, in the event that the Counterparty is (x)
the sole Affected Party in respect of an Additional Termination Event or a Tax
Event Upon Merger or (y) the Defaulting Party in respect of any Event of
Default, then the following provisions will apply:

is a Substitute Swap Provider, (2) for an amount that would be paid to the
Trust (expressed as a negative number) or by the Trust (expressed as a
positive number) in consideration of an agreement between the Trust and such
Reference Market-maker to enter into a Replacement Transaction that would have
the effect of preserving for the Trust the economic equivalent of the
Terminated Transactions, and (3) made on the basis that Unpaid Amounts in
respect of the Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions are
to be excluded but, without limitation, any payment or delivery that would,
but for the relevant Early Termination Date, have been required (assuming
satisfaction of each applicable condition precedent) after that Early
Termination Date is to be included.

(B) The definition of Settlement Amount shall be deleted in its entirety and
replaced with the following:

"**_Settlement Amount_** " means, with respect to any Early Termination Date,

Quotation for the relevant Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated
Transactions that is accepted by the Trust so as to become legally binding,
provided that:



  | (a) | if, on or prior to such Early Termination Date, a Market Quotation for the relevant Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions is accepted by the Trust so as to become legally binding, the Termination Currency Equivalent of the amount (whether positive or negative) of such Market Quotation;
---|---|---



  | (b) | if, on such Early Termination Date, no Market Quotation for the relevant Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions is accepted by the Trust so as to become legally binding and one or more Market Quotations have been communicated to the Trust and remain capably of becoming legally binding upon acceptance by the Trust, the Termination Currency Equivalent of the amount (whether positive or negative) of the lowest of such Market Quotation;
---|---|---



  | (c) | if, on such Early Termination Date, no Market Quotation for the relevant Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions is accepted by the Trust so as to become legally binding and no Market Quotations have been communicated to the Trust and remain capable of becoming legally binding upon acceptance by the Trust, the Trust's Loss (whether positive or negative and without reference to Unpaid Amounts) for the relevant Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions; and
---|---|---



  | (d) | At any time on or before such Early Termination Date at which two or more Market Quotations have been communicated to the Trust and remain capable of becoming legally binding upon acceptance by the Trust, the Trust shall be entitled to accept only the lowest of such Market Quotations (for the avoidance of doubt, (i) a Market Quotation expressed as a negative number is lower than a Market Quotation expressed as a positive number and (ii) the lower of two Market Quotations expressed as negative numbers is the one with the largest absolute value)."
---|---|---




* * *

(C) If the Trust requests the Counterparty in writing to obtain Market
Quotations, the Counterparty shall use its reasonable efforts to do so before
the Early Termination Date.

(D) If the Settlement Amount is a negative number, Section 6(e)(i)(3) shall be
deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:

Quotation apply, (I) the Trust shall pay to the Counterparty an amount equal
to the absolute value of the Settlement Amount in respect of the Terminated
Transactions, (II) the Trust shall pay to the Counterparty the Termination
Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to the Counterparty and (III)
the Counterparty shall pay to the Trust the Termination Currency Equivalent of
the Unpaid Amounts owing to the Trust; provided, however, that (x) the amounts
payable under the immediately preceding clauses (II) and (III) shall be
subject to netting in accordance with Section 2(c) of this Agreement and (y)
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any amount payable by
the Counterparty under the immediately preceding clause (III) shall not be
netted-off against any amount payable by the Trust under the immediately
preceding clause (I)."

(ii) The Trust will be obligated to pay interest to the Counterparty on any
amounts due and unpaid under Section 6(e) provided that the Applicable Rate
used in calculating such interest shall be a rate equal to the Floating Rate
Option specified under the related Confirmation.

take any reasonable steps required to be taken by it to effect such transfer.

communication (written or oral) of the other party as investment advice or as
a recommendation to enter into this Agreement or any Transaction hereunder, it
being understood that information and explanations related to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and any Transaction hereunder shall not be
considered investment advice or a recommendation to enter into this Agreement
or any Transaction hereunder; (3) no communication (written or oral) received
from the other party shall be deemed to be an assurance or
