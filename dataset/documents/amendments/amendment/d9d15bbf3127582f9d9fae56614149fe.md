contract or other agreement to which Halifax is a party (other than any such
contract or agreement entered into with Scotia), (j) all Indebtedness of the
type described in clauses (a) through (i) above guaranteed directly or
indirectly in any manner, or in effect guaranteed directly or indirectly
through an agreement (i) to pay or purchase such Indebtedness or to advance or
supply funds for the payment or purchase of such Indebtedness, (ii) to

services, primarily for the purpose of enabling the debtor to make payment of
such Indebtedness or to assure the holder of such Indebtedness against loss,

whether such property is received or such services are rendered) or (iv)
otherwise to assure a creditor against loss, and (k) all Indebtedness of the
type described in clauses (a) through (j) above secured by (or for which the
holder of such Indebtedness has an existing right, contingent or otherwise, to
be secured by) any Lien on property (including accounts and contract rights)
forming part of the assets of Halifax even though Halifax has not assumed or
become liable for payment of such Indebtedness. "Capitalized Leases" means all
leases that have been or should be, in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles as applied in Canada, recorded as capitalized leases.
"Liens" means any mortgage, pledge, hypothecation, assignment for security,
encumbrance, lien (statutory or other), security interest or other security
device or arrangement of any kind or nature whatsoever (including any
conditional sale or other title retention agreement and any lease having
substantially the same effect as any of the foregoing).
